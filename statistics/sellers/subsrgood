<p>UPDATES: Read these periodically. This is how I WILL COMMUNICATE a message to those of you who have orders outstanding if there is going to be any delay or news.</p>

<p>2.10.2015- We are now OFFERING HIGH QUALITY #4 AFGHAN HEROIN!</p>

<p>*******EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW**************************</p>

<p>             YOUR BOY, THE OG FROM SR1 IS BACK!!!
<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />We have been doing this now for over 4 years. By the grace of god and customers like yourselves I am still around and living in this free market economy. I consider myself to be very lucky and have made mistakes along with way. By now we have this down to a science. I know people do not like to FE and I understand this as someone who  likes to buy once in awhile but I could wake up tomorrow and a markert could be gone and I will never see that money again. This has happened to me over 4 times now, while I think Dream is the best market in the industry right now, anything can happen. For those of you who know me I vend on one market. I will be here at DREAM and hope to do business with you.  </p>

<p>***PLEASE DO NOT ENCRYPT MESSAGES FOR SIMPLE CHIT-CHAT. If you are divulging sensirve information ok but use privnote or temp.pm to send me a secure message. I will never get back to everyone this way. </p>

<p>Lastly, many of you have asked about the #4 Situation. I am going to say this, as of now we are concentrating on very very high quality tar direct from the cartel and high quality super lab methamphetamine. You are first in line before anything is touched. I do not cut my dope. </p>

<p>***ALSO, Please realize that tar is not Afghan #4 and it just should not be compared against powder in your feedback. There is about $100 in price difference  here. Please do not leave feedback saying the product is weak because your tolerance is out the roof. This is as good as it gets guys in terms of tar. For those of you who remember NOD, from the SR1 days, this is comparable to that. </p>

<p>BUYER AGREEMENT
<br />When purchasing from us, you agree to all terms and conditions specified on our product listing pages, vendor profile and forum FAQ. It is your responsibility to read the info posted on these pages, and follow our operating guidelines. Be sure to familiarize yourself with our operating schedule which is (5pm-2am CST** See below), shipping times, refund/reship policies, feedback and finalize requirements. Since I have a day job during that time I will process orders to go out the following morning. I will also answer PM's at this time as well.  Our practices are fair and successful. If you have a problem with our terms or policies, do not waste our time or yours. 
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>

<p>MESSAGES
<br />Read my FAQ (coming Soon) as it answers nearly all of the questions I receive regularly. If your question is not answered in the FAQ, please message me. If your question has been answered in my FAQ, I will not respond to your message. I will only respond to messages via PM on Dream Market. In the event that the Dream Market main site is unavailable, I can be contacted via email at SUBSRGOOD@sigaint.org. Please use privnote or general text For messages so I can get back to you right away even if away from my computer. 
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />PRICING
<br />Prices are set in US dollars, but BTC fluctuates. If a purchase is cancelled or refunded, you will not receive the same dollar amount back, but the amount of BTC from the purchase you are allowed to have.
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>

<p>SHIPPING
<br />Shipping Methods and ESTIMATED Delivery Times - </p>

<p>PLEASE SEE SHIPPING METHODS FOR ESTIMATED TIMES... NO MORE TRACKING IS BEING GIVEN EXCEPT FOR Express tracking available after 2 days.</p>

<p>Orders will ship out within 24-48 hours of being marked in transit.  I process orders in the order that they are received.  I will not expedite the processing of your order so please don't ask.
<br />Please DO NOT message me asking about my thoughts on if a package will make it to your destination.  I don't have an answer!  As such, I will just refer you to my shipping info link to read.
<br />Orders sent out via Tracked Shipping typically take 24-48 hours to register in the courier’s system.  DO NOT message me for at least 2 business days from the time of your tracking information is provided asking why you can’t track your package.  Be patient!  It will show up in the system.  
<br />If after 3 business days, it hasn’t registered, please feel free to message me. Also, there have been some deliveries in the past, primarily International Express deliveries that never show up in the system at all and then suddenly arrive at the recipients address. 
<br />We estimated, based on the transactions we have done and the refunds given, that well over 98% of our packages have been successfully delivered.
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />FINALIZE EARLY/FE
<br />Finalize Early is not Required at this time, but is appreciated!  </p>

<p>We expect all buyers who finalize early to leave either a 5/5 feedback rating or to leave no feedback at all when finalizing early and then fill in your feedback when you receive your order. Leaving anything else is unacceptable.  
<br />If you have an issue with your order, PM us immediately so we can attempt to resolve the issue. If we are unable to come to an understanding, then feel free to change your feedback. Sorry guys Vendors are the ones at the most risk of getting fucked over by markets. Lost a lot from this and learned a lot too. 
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />RISK
<br />Over 98% of our orders have been successfully delivered worldwide. The odd order does not arrive for any of a number of reasons (incorrect address, fake name, observant mailman, watched address, incorrect delivery, lost or stolen, and seizure by customs). 
<br />We are not out to scam anyone, selectively or otherwise. Any PMs or forum posts stating/suggesting that we are scammers will result in your account being banned from purchasing from us in the future and your user name will be shared with the other vendors of the site so they do not have to deal with any of your potential allegations and to prevent you from trying to ruin the reputation of other vendors. 
<br />Do not delay in contacting us if you suspect a delivery problem. Waiting 6 weeks or more after placing your order and then contacting us to say your order never showed and that you want a refund is too long to wait. You had plenty of time to contact us about non-delivery, and 6 weeks or more is too long to wait.
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />REFUND
<br />Refunds are only provided after 1 month has passed from the date your item was marked in transit sent Standard Post, If tracked we can do it sooner.  You MUST provide your transaction number in order to be able to receive a refund.
<br />If you Finalized Early and your package does not arrive, you will receive whatever refund you are eligible for. 
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Refunds are not given for any order that doesn’t arrive due to improperly addresses packages.  I will specify exactly how you should provide your address - go to www.addressdoctor.com and try the interactive version of international addressing formats.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />New Buyer Resolutions: If you have 2 or less purchases on Dream, you qualify for a 25% refund.  However, if you ordered with Tracked Shipping, you qualify for a 50% refund. 
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Established Buyer Resolutions:  If you have more than 2 purchases on Dream, you qualify for a 50% refund for packages sent via Standard Post or Tracked Shipping. 
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />For custom or large quantity orders, refunds will be determined on a case by case basis.
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>

<p>FEEDBACK
<br />Seller reputation is everything in a market like this, and we strive for 5/5. That can only be provided by you, the buyer. Make sure that you provide feedback for EVERY ORDER. If, for whatever reason, you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us immediately (BEFORE YOU POST FEEDBACK) so we can ensure your satisfaction. </p>
