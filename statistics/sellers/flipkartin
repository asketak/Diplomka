<p>Kindly read on.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► HOW WE WORK ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>▌All sensitive communication has to be encrypted by PGP. We accept only Bitcoin.
<br />▌We will follow the policies mentioned  below, inorder to maximize OPSEC.</p>

<p>▌We believe in escrow, even for the goblins. However certain prices require FE.

<p>★ Our priority is existing orders; if you have placed an order, we offer top customer service. If you are planning to order, please read our profile for information.

<p>★ We ship from many places including EU and guarantee to ship your order in a timely fashion. We are not responsible for shipping times and delays - we do not control the post.</p>

<p>▌Please be patient with your order. We are not a fast shipping service, we operate slow. Our aim is to provide quality products at affordable costs, we do not promise quick delivery.</p>

<p>★ Do not FE if you are not comfortable with it. FE does not mean faster delivery or special service.</p>

<p>★ If you have any problems with our terms or are going to message us each day for status/tracking etc, we cannot help you. Kindly save us the hassle and do not order from us.</p>

<p>★ Users who no not follow our policies and attempt to fraud/scam us will be blacklisted by us and your details will also be added to vendor-only forum boards across all markets for other vendors to be aware of.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► PRODUCTS ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► MESSAGES ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>▌We strive to provide the best customer service for our valued customers. 
<br />That said, our inboxes are always flooded and we can reply to messages only once per day and weekends are our off-time.</p>

<p>▌We will answer all messages about an existing order that you have placed. Please give us upto 2 days to answer your questions.
<br />▌Messages about sample/products/small quantity/quality/price/discount and general chit-chat will be answered slowly or we may not answer at all.</p>

<p>▌If you are asking a question about an order please mention ORDER ID and the PINCODE you ordered to.</p>

<p>★ NOTE: We can check tracking only after 7 days after shipping. For questions regarding tracking, please wait upto 7 days before asking them.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► LISTINGS  ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>▌If you see a listing, it is available for shipping.
<br />▌If a quantity is already available, do not ask us to make custom listings, samples, etc.</p>

<p>▌Individual listings will have details regarding the product (source/dosage/grade). Listings may also have different shipping options.</p>

<p>▌Different products are considered as shipped separately, there is no combined shipping.</p>

<p>★ For tracked shipping select the correct option in the listing. 
<br />NOTE: Some items are always shipped with tracking.
<br />For others this option is only available on a few listings. </p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► HOW TO ORDER FROM US ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>★ Read our entire profile information, and then read the listing in detail. </p>

<p>★ Once you have understood all the terms, feel confident placing your order.</p>

<p>▌Listings may have different shipping options, please select the appropriate one.
<br />▌While placing the order, ensure correct address with name and use PGP tool, or select auto-encrypt.</p>

<p>▌Orders placed cannot be cancelled by customers. It is our sole discretion to cancel it, only if it has not been shipped.</p>

<p>▌Once you place your order, please wait for it and read our shipping timelines below. Do not send us repeated messages about your order.</p>

<p>★ PLEASE NOTE: Customers with weird slang languages, strange questions regarding product, stealth, discounts, messages of address/location without pgp, and so on will simply be ignored and all pending orders cancelled. </p>

<p>★ IF YOUR ORDER WAS CANCELLED, IT MEANS EITHER THE ADDRESS IS INCOMPLETE OR YOU ARE IN THE BANNED LIST/BLACKLIST.</p>

<p>▌Once we receive your order through the market, if something is not correct we will inform you or cancel your order.
<br />▌If everything is alright, it will be “accepted”, processed and shipped out within 1-3 days. </p>

<p>★ If you do not hear from us within 24 hours of placing the order, it means the details are correct.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► ADDRESS FORMAT ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>▌It is customer's responsibility to provide a complete, good and working address. </p>

<p>These are general guidelines:</p>

<p>-If you receive regular post/bills/etc it means the address is serviceable. The best drops are the ones which already receive several bank/phone bills, magazines, etc regularly.
<br />Use the complete address that is on those telephone/bank bills. 
<br />You can also try sending a slow mail to yourself to check this.</p>

<p>Business establishments / office address / apartment complexes have high success rates. 
<br />An address should ideally have full information including plot/door number/road name/ landmark/ etc.</p>

<p>★ ALWAYS INCLUDE A REAL NAME! Mail carriers will often take the package back to the post office if name on the mailbox doesn't match and you won't be able to retrieve it without that person's ID.</p>

<p>★ Mention your COMPLETE address with PERSON NAME, BUILDING, STREET/ROAD NAME, SUB AREA, POSTAL CODE (PIN), CITY and STATE. No need to mention 'India' for domestic orders. </p>

<p>★ Orders not following these may be rejected and will not have any refunds/reships if problems arise.</p>

<p>★ You can also include a telephone number (completely upto you).</p>

<p>Your address must look like this:</p>

<p>Mr. Ram Kumar,
<br />101, Ram Apartments,
<br />No: 623, 3rd Cross, Jawaharlal Street,
<br />Mahatma Gandhi Road,
<br />Mumbai
<br />Maharashtra - 400001</p>

<p>Mobile: 79885-87769</p>

<p>★ We will use the exact address given by you and we are not responsible for any errors you have made in the address. </p>

<p>★ For international address formatting, please refer here:
<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_(geography)</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► STEALTH ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>▌We use top level stealth to make sure your order blends in with regular letters or business airmail or regular internet orders (electronics etc)</p>

<p>▌Your package will look like a regular postal item, and hence do not dispose of any mail that you may receive.</p>

<p>▌For small items the stealth will focus on making the package look as regular and boring as possible. For cannabis we use layers of MBBs with vacuum seal.</p>

<p>▌No messages regarding what stealth we use or custom stealth.</p>

<p>▌Do not mention about the appearance or stealth/decoy of the our packages in any reviews on forums/markets.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► SHIPPING ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>We ship from several undisclosed locations worldwide.</p>

<p>We will always ensure your order arrives. We have a order delivery success rate of 100%.</p>

<p>★ Orders will be shipped out thrice a week (Mon -&gt; Fri).</p>

<p>Orders placed after Friday 10 AM will be sent out following week.</p>

<p>★ If your order is marked ACCEPTED, it means it will be sent. Now you just have to be patient and wait for the order. 
<br />Please don't message us EVERYDAY asking when it will be shipped, where your item is, when it will reach you etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes an order may be marked as “shipped” immediately, sometimes 2-3 days later, this does not matter.</p>

<p>After processing your order we will delete all information about to it.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► DOMESTIC SHIPPING TIMES ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>★ Different listings have different shipping times. We do not offer any time guarantee and please understand this before ordering. If your order is late it is the post's fault and not ours.</p>

<p>★ If your order is accepted or marked as shipped, it will be sent out within 2-3 working days.</p>

<p>Metro cities have fast shipping</p>

<p>▌Big Cities(Metros): 2-6 business days 
<br />▌Tier-II Cities/Other capitals: 3-10 business days
<br />▌Tier-III/Villages/Panchayats: &gt;11 business days</p>

<p>Shipping estimates DO NOT include weekends and holidays so please factor these while calculating the number of days. 
<br />Postal hubs do not work over weekends.</p>

<p>★ Based on this, please estimate how many days it may take to your city. We do not answer questions about delivery times for specific cities.</p>

<p>REMEMBER: The slow nature of post means there is no time guarantee. Sometimes order may take upto 18 days!</p>

<p>★ Tracked orders may arrive sooner but need to be SIGNED AT DELIVERY. </p>

<p>All tracked orders have to be signed to receive so please ensure that you are there to receive it. It can arrive in just 1 day, or at times can take upto 6 days - this is not in our control.</p>

<p>★ Packages sent from EU to India are always tracked priority. This ensures 100% successful delivery.</p>

<p>★ Orders rarely have problems. They may reach you late due to postal/political/natural situations.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING TIMES ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>★ Small international packs are sent as express/registered documents. This offers the best stealth along with low risk of inspection by customs.</p>

<p>★ Larger packs are sent with a decoy. We have good success with larger packs.</p>

<p>★ The estimated shipping times including custom clearance are: </p>

<p>Nepal/Sri Lanka/Pakistan/Bangladesh/Middle East/Thailand - 5-9 days
<br />Japan/China/Indonesia/Singapore/Malaysia - 7-12 days
<br />EU/South America/Rest of the world - 14 days</p>

<p>Sometimes International packs take over a month.</p>

<p>We do not ship to USA</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► TRACKING ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>► WE DO NOT SHARE ANY TRACKING INFORMATION. </p>

<p>Once your order is sent, do not message us for the tracking or to check tracking. 
<br />Only for established customers WITH large bulk orders, we will waive this and provide tracking at our discretion. </p>

<p>▌ For all small orders and new customers:
<br />-  Once you place your order please wait for 12 days to receive the order. We will not offer any service to check tracking within this period.</p>

<p>★ Once this 12 WORKING DAYS has passed, message us about the status. Please don't ask for the status before this time period.</p>

<p>Remember that once we send an order out, we do not control its speed.</p>

<p>While communicating about an order please include the order ID(What you ordered) and PIN CODE you ordered to, so that we can look into it.</p>

<p>▌If it was sent with tracking, we can update you with the latest status after 12 days.
<br />If there is no delivery after 17 days or a mistake due to our fault we will offer 100% reship. </p>

<p>As a vendor our aim is to have happy customers; we will always work with you to ensure you receive your order.</p>

<p>If your address is good, things seldom go wrong. 
<br />However, we are also aware of the various scam opportunities and attempts to obtain free product. 
<br /> 
<br />We have been around for long enough to know what arrives and what does not, and we have hundreds of customers with whom we have a great professional relationship and whose orders always arrive.  </p>

<p>We will offer reship in CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES &amp; will be dealt with on a case to case basis. </p>

<p>Refunds/reships only after 17 days (Domestic)
<br />International orders may take longer, even upto a month.</p>

<p>▌All refunds/reships are on our sole discretion based on your market profile standing and history.
<br />▌If you raise a dispute on the market without first communicating about it to us, the moderators will deal with that and we will not help you any further.
<br />▌ZERO reship/refunds for first time customers. 
<br />▌Maximum of 25% refund/50% reship for repeat customers. Letters simply do not stop arriving to an address for no reason.
<br />▌Reships will only be sent to a new address. </p>

<p>★ NOTE: If you request a reship/refund for any order, depending on the circumstances we may not ship any further orders to you in the future, 
<br />and also no more future reships will be provided to you.</p>

<p>For any order with tracking, we offer a 100% reship if it doesn't arrive for genuine reasons.
<br />NOTE THAT tracking is only there to check if an order has arrived or not, we will not share tracking for new customers/small orders.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: All the terms mentioned in our profile are not negotiable and please do not place an order if you are not comfortable with them.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>

<p>	
<br />Q. I want to order multiple items, will you ship it at once or should I select shipping 2 times?
<br />- Most orders are shipped separately so please select the appropriate shipping option on each listing. 
<br />Depending on the circumstances, if the extra shipping costs are not needed we will refund it back to you.</p>

<p>Q. I want to order X can I place the order.
<br />- If you can see the listing, you can place the order. You don't need to message us for this.</p>

<p>Q. What kind of stealth do you use?
<br />-Privacy and safety of our customers in our priority, and we guarantee high level of stealth even for domestic orders. Request you to go through our feedback/reviews from several happy customers!</p>

<p>Q. I want my order shipped by a private courier!
<br />-There is no such option and this is not up for discussion, we may use private for some express or tracked orders and it is our discretion only.</p>

<p>Q. I ordered with tracking, can you please quickly look at that and give me an update?
<br />-Please message us only after 12 working days for a status update.
<br />We will always ensure the delivery of your order so please wait patiently for your order to be delivered</p>

<p>Q. Can you send me the tracking number I want to collect it from the office.
<br />- Unfortunately we cannot share tracking number.</p>

<p>Q. Will the cannabis be visible when someone opens the pack? What about hash? 
<br />-We always use top level stealth vacuum sealed with MBB to prevent odor and also a visual barrier; on general inspection the drugs will be concealed. 
<br />However as far as any stealth goes, it is still drugs hidden inside an envelope and tearing through layers/close inspection will reveal the contents so remember to plan around this if you are ordering to your mother’s home.</p>

<p>Q. I want LSD on my own/custom artwork.
<br />-Yes, we can lay that for orders above 900x.</p>

<p>Q. How is the LSD laid? Can you make a 400ug blot?
<br />-LSD is laid onto tabs using a micropipette. Yes we can lay any custom dosage over 900x and also maybe vials if you are interested.</p>

<p>Q. How many joints will one gram hash make? How many joints will one gram weed give?
<br />-This depends from person to person so I could not give you a definite answer.</p>

<p>Q. I want 5g MDMA + 10g Weed. Can you make a custom?
<br />-Please order the listings that are available. We can make custom orders only for large quantities.</p>

<p>Q. What is edible oil? Do you have wax, BHO etc etc.
<br />-Individual listings have description inside the listing, you can refer to that. 
<br />If we have any product it will be listed, if you do not find them, it means we don’t have it.</p>

<p>▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇► QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT ENTERTAINED ▆▇▆▇▆▇▆▇</p>
