<p>This goes out to all the scammers: We are one of the very few honest vendors on all DNM's, show some respect and don't ruin it for the honest buyers!</p>

<p>About us:
<br />We aim to bring you the best quality products for the lowest price possible.
<br />All questions will be answered within 24 hours or less.</p>

<p>FEEDBACK
<br />Finding a reliable vendor/buyer and vice versa is a BIG DEAL in this time of period. Therefore returning customers will benefit loyalty from MrMaserati when they write feedback!</p>

<p>IMPORTANT
<br />- Re-order only possible with positive or neutral feedback and WITHOUT ANY ISSUES as we know very good what we are doing.</p>

<p>- Re-ship 50% after package being seized (you should show some proof (letter from customs))</p>

<p>- Returning customers are entitled to 50% refund or 50% reship if no-show after 15 business days. Outside EU up to 40 business days, depending the location.</p>

<p>We will handle each situation with care and make sure we find a solution that fits both parties. New customers without previous orders on ANY market will get 0% refund and 0% reship BUT we will carefully look at the situation and negotiate a solution. This is our way to protect us from scams.</p>

<p>Q. I need my gear on friday because it's my birthday, will they arrive on time if I order today?
<br />A. We can never guarantee shipping times. If you need them on time, order a week before!</p>
