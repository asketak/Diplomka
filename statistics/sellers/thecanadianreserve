<p>~PSA~Ok, I've been really busy with work doing my day job and orders have been a bit slow on here so Here is what I am going to be doing from now on ; I will take orders during the week and put them out if I have time, however most likely I will not be able to put them out until the FOLLOWING friday-sat from when the order was placed. So if you place an order Tuesday, I will do my best to get it out asap but its likely I won't be able to put it out until Friday. Thanks in advance. Hopefully this works out for everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks, TCR</p>

<p>Welcome to the <b>Canadian Reserve</b>, where we have only the best to offer of Canada's finest West Coast Bud. </p>

<p>As it stands currently I do not offer Registered mail or tracked packages. Please note this before you purchase from me as I will not be able to provide such information if asked. I will however be looking into it for future orders, however as a heads up the shipping cost will be substantially higher than it is currently. Check back for more details at a later date. Thank you!</p>

<p>So, I've been getting a lot of questions in regards to my pricing and about different sizes. So in regards to my what some would say INSANELY cheap pricing is very simple, I need reviews, I want to make a name for myself as a new Vendor, and I have a large supply. I'm aiming for that 100 positive reviews so that my listings will start to show up without me having to pay for adds.  Once I reach those numbers, you can expect my prices to start going up slowely but surely until they are closer to the market norm. I do however plan to keep my listings 15-20% less than my competition as its pretty hard for anyone in the world to compete with Canada in regards to affordable Weed. </p>

<p>Will ship orders ASAP or generally  within 24hrs of receiving Mon-Fri when able to do so.
<br /> -We take order's over the weekend, however they will not be shipped until the following Monday. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p> - Please dispute your order, if you are concerned about a delay in delivery. I take no offence to this and its a very good way to get my attention. I will try and amend the situation as fast as possible. </p>

<p> - There are an insane amount of small things that can add up and cause for packages to be delivered or put out later than quoted,  with that in mind I strongly suggest ordering in ADVANCE for when you need the product and not WHEN you NEED it right away. It is a great idea to order several weeks in advance and to put your next order in before your current supply runs out. 
<br />Thank you for your understanding</p>

<p>If I have answered your question there is no need to message me back in response, I will not be offended. Thank You!</p>

<p>Orders will take roughly 5 days to land in Canada-United States, and roughly 7-10 days Internationally.</p>

<p>Will ship in standard mail. Product will appear to be a postcard or other small mail item. Product will be packaged in 8mil Mylar, with cardboard sleeve, and an additional Mylar envelope. The sealed product is than moved to a staging room, where it is left overnight to insure the seal is intact. At this point the sealed product is put in an alcohol bath and moved to a clean room for final inspection to insure no package has lost its seal before being shipped to its destination.  There will be minor to sometimes severe compression of the product, it is however not vacuum sealed and it will regain some of its original form.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns feel free to message us at any time, we will respond as soon as possible. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>We are happy to do custom orders for larger amounts upon request.</p>

<p>All photo's are of our actual product, taken before packaging.
<br />All Product is INDOOR, unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>Product Code:
<br /> Pk      =  1
<br /> OGK   = 2
<br /> MK     = 3
<br /> PC      = 4
<br /> OC     = 5</p>

<p><b> Any attempts to blackmail TheCanadianReserve with poor reviews in order to receive extra product of reships will be reported to the admins. Drugs ordered online may not arrive all the time, its unfortunate, but sometimes packages are stopped at customs or stolen by postal workers. Please be fully aware of the risks involved and that your package may not arrive. I will do my best to work something out with trusted customers, however Full Refunds and Reships are no longer going to be available for non-registered mail. If your registered package fails to arrive, please dispute it for you will receive a 50% refund on your purchase or allow me to try and reship </b></p>
