<p>My PGP key expired recently. When I created the key 5 years ago, it had a 5 year time limit. It's still a valid key, but it may give you some issues depending on which software suite you are using. My new key has already been made. I'm leaving a copy of my old key here just for proof of authenticity. haneWIN's JavascriptPG is one example of a tool that ignores PGP key expirations. http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGcrypt.htm</p>

<p>3.5 MILLION UNITS SOLD since Silk Road 1 back in 2012. There are many reason to choose Righteousness, and all you have to do is read my endless list of feedback to see for yourself.</p>

<p>born too late to explore the earth
<br />born to early to explore the galaxy
<br />born just in time to explore psychedelics ordered off of the Internet</p>

<p>® USA ONLY. NO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
<br />® Especially no shipping to Brazil. Fuck those Brazilians for for sending me a million requests to ship there
<br />® NO I will not negotiate prices
<br />® NO I will not send you a front
<br />® NO I will not do a custom quantity. My service to you is extremely simple and efficient, and it's priced accordingly. Custom orders require 10 times the amount of time to fulfill. I'm not interested.
<br />® NO I will not do custom packaging, and I do not discuss my method of stealth. My stealth method requires uniformity. That's all that you need to know.
<br />® NO FUCK YOUR MoneyPak
<br />® NO FUCK YOUR MoneyGram
<br />® NO these are not COMPLEXED. COMPLEXING would be useless for HYDROCHLORIDE NBOMe
<br />® NO I will not send you 0.00000001 BTC because you're short and can't place your order
<br />® NO I will not write a book for you about the differences between 25I/B/C. You please write the book for me so that I can continue to focus on logistics/security/research/customer service and pretty much everything related to vending.
<br />® NO I will not send you an ETA, because my shipping times are already clearly described below on my profile. Unless I have a notice stating otherwise on my profile, you can count on all orders being processed like clockwork every business day.
<br />® NO I will not msg you letting you know when your purchase has been shipped. It will say "in transit" on your Orders page. There's no need for me to msg you.
<br />® NO I will not share the tracking with you. You can 100% count on tracking numbers to never be checked using Tor, and none of the other customers that ordered on the same day as you will ever be able to check their tracking numbers on Tor while your order is in transit either.
<br />® NO I don't produce 25I, 25B, or 25C anymore</p>

<p>That may seem like a not of NOs, but to for those of you who are looking for a solid vendor,
<br />★ YES my service is solid
<br />★ YES my products are excellent
<br />★ YES my processing times are stellar
<br />★ YES I'm a top-notch high security professional with international connections, multiple teams of researchers and chemists, and I'm a tried and true community driven raver, burner, programmer/IT specialist, and psychedelic connoisseur ❣❣❣
<br />★ YES I send to PO boxes (why the f do people keep asking me this?)</p>

<p>★★ SHIPPING OPTIONS ★★
<br />▨ First Class == 3 to 14 days, but the average time is 5 days ↔ only for quantities of x5 through x250
<br />▨ Priority == 2 to 7 days, but it usually only takes 2 ↔ only for quantities of x400 and above</p>

<p>Envelopes get dropped off at the post office within 1 business day. I rarely miss a day. And if there's a day that I might be missing, I almost always have a notice on my profile page explaining beforehand so that you'll know what to expect. Orders typically don't get processed same-day unless they are placed shortly after midnight. Keep in mind that orders made on Saturday aren't going to be processed until the post office reopens on Monday. Another example worth noting is that if you place an Express order on say a Tuesday afternoon, keep in mind that it won't get dropped off at the post office until Wednesday, so you won't be receiving it until Thursday. None of my shipping options will require interaction with the postman. They will arrive in your mail box with no signature required. Also don't be alarmed that I don't msg you with a warm welcoming msg for each order that you place. As much as I would like to have an automated msg greeting everybody and giving them confirmation that their envelope made it to the post office on time like say eBay, the orders panel on my end is designed to be as low-bandwidth and efficient as possible and therefore does not have any tools for me to effectively send out confirmation msgs. If the status of your transaction says it's being shipped, and I haven't msged you saying anything about a problem with your address, then yes I have processed your order successfully.
<br />NO INTERNATIONAL. Please do not ask me to do international orders.</p>

<p>★★ NO FREEBEES ★★
<br />I shouldn't have to say this, but I keep getting people asking me almost every day for free samples or fronts. Please don't ask me for freebees, fronts or any kind of discount. I'm already working around the clock to keep up with orders and I hardly have any free time to enjoy myself, so I don't care if your 0.002 bitcoins short for the quantity that you're looking for. Less work for me! I'm already undercutting the prices of other vendors on the deep, and asking me to make you a special deal because you're broke-nig is a sure way to make me not interested in doing business with you. Considering I've spent well over $100,000 in my career hunting down the best products from the best suppliers for you, I fully expect you to be willing to invest at least $15 for an x5 if you're legitimate. Don't get me wrong. I love sharing my products with people, and I love hearing from people that are emerging in their community as a reputable provider, but my focus needs to be on continuously spending my time and efforts to be of better service to my clients that have already established their own integrity and experience in dealing with psychedelics. They deserve my priority. With that said, please don't send me msgs explaining that there is a festival coming up and you're trying to get as much as possible beforehand. I can't even count how many times I've received this kind of request. There will always be festivals. No fronts. Stay debt free. Life is better when you're debt free.</p>

<p>★★ RESHIP POLICY ★★
<br />It's your responsibility to make sure that you provide me with an accurate address. If it has been 10 days and you still haven't received your order in your mail box, contact me and resend me your transaction number and recipient information so that I can investigate. If I determine that your envelope is lost by USPS, I will reship, but I will not reship if USPS shows me confirmation that your envelope arrived. I do not refund or reship for erroneous addresses either.</p>

<p>★★ PAYMENT ★★
<br />I only accept payment through the bitcoin escrow system. No exceptions. So don't ask. Bitcoins are an integral part of what makes this service so secure (and so fun). Also please don't ask me how to use the shopping system. Prove to me that you are a competent adult and that you can figure these parts out on your own. I do not intend to do business with children or anyone that seems to lack a basic understanding of the nature of this business or how to use one of the simplest shopping cart systems ever made.
<br />http://howtobuybitcoins.info for the win</p>

<p>★★ TRUE STORY ★★
<br />I have an extremely high standard in the quality of my product and the integrity of my service. I love love love meeting professionals that have the same passion for exploring and sharing psychedelics as I do. I aspire to be the most secure and reliable dealer that I can possibly be for you. I'm at your service. I'm not interested in doing business with people show signs of having a destructive life-style, and I am likely to refuse business that I feel may have a negative impact on our society. My passion is to be a provider of tools that encourage happiness, positive relationship experiences, higher awareness and creativity. May the force be with Dread Pirate Roberts and may the Righteous continue to research for the win.</p>
