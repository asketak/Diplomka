<p>Welcome To Homeostasis</p>

<p>I am not new to this world :) I had over 6000 Sales on my account on Agora, it was the best time of my life, i was healing many and providing top cannabinoids products to great customers, i am now back better than ever before, my products have improved further and my sources, i am focused and ready not just to sell. but to heal, on a case by case basis, even if you just want some positive vibes, drop me a message, honestly, the world works when we stick together :)</p>

<p>We all need balance in life, the endocannabinoid system is all about balance and homeostasis in the body, the healing effects from cannabis are miraculous from first hand experience, scientific research and spiritual belief</p>

<p>My products are the best of the cannabis world, i am into healing so if you need any help of advice please ask :) I have been making capsules with all kinds of hash oils and hashes over the years, ever since i found out about the magical oil through rick simpson and the powerful community over in canada exposing the cure-all effects of the oils from the plant, if you would like a nice documentary to watch while high this really changed my life and blew my mind - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmYNLNF7NBw</p>

<p>I feel i have come a long way at the Old Alchemy, re-introducing terpenes with LemonGrass Oil lost in the heat which directly effect the cannabinoid system while giving it the wonderful floral lemony smell, Manuka Honey for the extra terpenes from all kinds of New Zealand flowers along with the medicinal properties of Manuka Honey itself , while keeping the Potion at low decarb heats to keep as many terpenes from the Purple Kush Oil and the BC Bubble Hash as possible, for more on terpenes - http://www.hightimes.com/read/talking-terpenes</p>

<p>I will be selling, Flowers, Hash, Hash Oil Capsules, CBD Gold Capulses and THC Toffees at 65MG THC</p>

<p>All my products will be of medical quality, i will only sell clean and the best, only something i would vape or consume :)</p>

<p>Read descriptions on products for good details :)</p>

<p>Love you all</p>
