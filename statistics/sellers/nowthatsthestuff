<br />░▒▓██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▒░
<br />░▒▓█MESSAGE TO MY CUSTOMERS:█▓▒░
<br />A welcome back sale on all products! if you have any questions feel free to pm me . i am here for you!
<br />░▒▓██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▒░
<br />░▒▓█I. INTRODUCTION
<br />░▒▓██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▒░
<br />NOTE- I will answer all PMs. If it is just a basic question, please don't use PGP, it's no secret what we are doing here. Only use PGP for sensitive information and address encryption.</p>

<p>HELLO &amp; Welcome! As a old school vendor from SR1 and  Sheep (#4foryou)http://directory4iisquf.onion/search?search_api_views_fulltext=%234foryou. I recently tried to join up for agora but my name was used as a scam I am sorry for those who did not look for my old pgp I love my customers and will do whatever it takes to put a smile on their face. EXTRA's of course for my loving customers.  To be a part of a site where the vendors and mods care for your needs this is the only place you will see me. We need our vendors to step up and begin caring about the end users. We need vendors willing to communicate and educate while promoting responsible, safe drug use. I am here for you even if it is not business related. </p>

<p>Another nice article about your expected experience. Also note stealth has reached an all time high. 
<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1lw6hb/vendor_review_nowthatsthestuff_4_heroin_stamp/</p>

<p>-PLEASE- message me if you have any questions about anything, that is why I am here. I am here for you. Without you I am nothing.</p>

<p>I am not an inexperienced vendor. I am not one to takes chances, I cherish my freedom; mine, along with your security and safety is my #1 priority.
<br />░▒▓██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▒░
<br />░▒▓█II. SHIPPING
<br />░▒▓██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▒░
<br />Safety and security is my #1 priority for everyones sake. I will not enter a post office with a package only for special orders. I will not drop packages into boxes anywhere near security cameras. I do not accept any sort of returns. This is real life and being safe is very important.</p>

<p>█KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THIS -&gt; I DO NOT use or provide any form of tracking or delivery confirmation. Tracking and confirmation is an unneeded security risk for both of us ANY TRACKING THAT NEEDS PROOF OF DEPARTURE WILL BE GIVEN TO A MOD. </p>

<p>PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR ADDRESS IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:</p>

<p>[NAME]
<br />[ADDRESS NUMBER][STREET NAME]
<br />[OPTIONAL: APARTMENT NUMBER]
<br />[CITY], [ABBREVIATED STATE] [ZIP CODE-ZIP EXTENSION IF KNOWN]</p>

<p>EXAMPLES:</p>

<p>John Doe
<br />123 Main St
<br />DINGDONG, NY 12345</p>

<p>John Doe
<br />123 Main St
<br />APT #2
<br />DINGDONG, NY 12345-1234</p>

<p>Here are the stages of a typical order:
<br />1) Pending. (You have placed your order and I have not seen it yet)
<br />2) PACKING. (I have seen your order, retrieved your address, and am currently preparing your package for shipment)
<br />3) Shipped. (I have returned from dropping your package and it is on its way. I do not mark orders as shipped until I have actually returned from making the drop.)
<br />4) Finalized. (You have received and finalized your order and are probably getting fucked up lol :P)</p>

<p>If you have any questions about shipping address format, please PM me and I will promptly reply.Please also capitalize your name, street, city, state accordingly. Please do not use all caps. Please do not use all lower case. Please do not use fake names. Please do not make up names that sound odd. The more professional and normal this appears, the more effective the stealth is. I always correct things but it adds time to my packaging. Please save me the time :). ALSO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU WILL GET IT WHEN EXPECTED SHOOT  ME A PM W/ ADDRESS AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE SHIPPING CALCULATOR TELLS ME

<br />░▒▓█III. PGP COMMUNICATIONS
<br />░▒▓██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▒░
<br />If you are sending me a message about anything, theres no need to use PGP. For sending your address when placing an order, PGP is not required but it is recommended for YOUR safety. Please ensure that your public PGP key is located in your profile. Here is my public PGP Key - </p>

<p>REMEMBER IM HERE FOR YOU!</p>

<br />5 of 5 This vendor has proven outstanding in every imaginable way. Prompt and very friendly communication, extremely fast shipment, phenomenal stealth, and EXCELLENT product. 6 out of 5 stars!!! Will definitely be back.</p>

<p>5 of 5 Out of all the sellers on SR I have never dealt with someone so professional, quick, and that stays in contact with his customers than NTTS. He shipped super fast, kept me in the loop, added extra for no reason, and is the most trustworthy vendor i have ever had the luck of meeting. If all vendors could be even 1/4th as awesome as NTTS SR would be perfect . Also did I mention his stuff is the BEST I’ve had!</p>

<p>5 of 5 BEST H ON THE ALL THE MARKETPLACES. sat-mon Shippiong. Fast!!!! Great Communication. Just placed large one, this is where he'll prove his worth, but I got not doubts, b/c two samples bages were bangging!</p>

<p>5 of 5 …. Both buyers and vendors often make the mistake of neglecting the importance of good security BUT Nowthatsthestuff does NOT make this mistake!! The security of the product was brilliant, the care taken with security alone could make me order from this vendor again. The fact that the #4 is fire at a good price just makes it all the better! Will be back for sure!</p>

<p>5 of 5 Honestly I was a little nervous, using a new market, new vendor and FE. But NTTS came through like a gentalmen and a scholar. And it's FIRE!</p>

<p>5 of 5 What an awesome vendor! Really appreciate the quick response and immediate shipping.
<br />This is the person you want to be working with!
<br />Hands down the best H vendor, best price, best communication always overweight. NTTS Fucking ROCKS!!!! THANK YOU BRO!! I Will be back</p>

<p>5 of 5 I never did receive the first letter that this vendor sent, and I was sure that he scammed me but he reshipped it with tracking and gave me 2x what I was suppose to get. This vendor is definitely legit, he cared more about the feedback I was going to leave than the product that he was selling. The product is also very good quality for stamps, large bags. Almost 2x as large as I am use to.</p>

<p>5 of 5 I really had an overall good experience with NOWTHATSTHESTUFF. He told me he was gonna give me 1.2 g since he was a day late checking the site, but instead, he gave me pretty much 1.5 grams of some fire tan #4 powder heroin. This stuff definitely ranks up there with the top batches of heroin I have tried. He was also quick and easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend
