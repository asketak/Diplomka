<p>*AK-47 FEMINIZED</p>

<p>This easy to grow strain is one of the most popular. It is of medium height and produces good yields quite quickly. It is an extremely strong smoke, and in turn has a very strong odor. The name was given not out of any idea of violence, but more in association with the ‘one hit wonder’ that the smoke is. These plants have a short flowering period for a sativa, producing compact, not too leafy buds that gleam with a coat of resin crystals.</p>

<p>*AMNESIA HAZE AUTOFLOWER FEMINIZED</p>

<p>The Amnesia Haze Automatic is the result of many years breeding. The biggest downside of Sativa strains like Amnesia is that it can take a while to flower, 12 weeks on average, but some phenotypes can take up 20 weeks. She can also grow quite tall; this can be another issue for some with limited space. The Amnesia Haze Automatic aims to solve these problems. Offering the same euphoric high and spicy, sweet taste as the original Amnesia but with a heavily reduced growth time and a much smaller height. Indoors she will take around 80 days from seed to bud. In this time she can grow quite large, especially when compared to other autoflowering strains. This is a clear sign of her Sativa dominant genetics - tall plants, large thin leaves and long stretching buds. The Amnesia Haze Automatic is a vigorous plant that can grow to heights of around 80-150 cm. This large Sativa dominant autoflowering strains, much like the original Amnesia, gives generous yields of high quality haze buds. After 80 days of growth and flowering you will be left with a good yield, around 40 grams on average and up to 150 grams in ideal conditions. She gives long, fox tail like buds with a sweet, spicy, musky aroma. All in all she has the classic Amnesia aroma, flavor and effect. The Amnesia Haze Automatic is the perfect autoflowering variety for lovers of the Haze.</p>

<p>*AMNESIA HAZE FEMINIZED</p>

<p>Amnesia is an unforgettable cannabis strain that is roughly 80% Sativa and the remaining 20% Indica. The plant itself is popular as a medicinal cannabis and it smells of cheese while carrying a very strong taste that even has hints of skunk to it.
<br />One of the reasons for the popularity of Amnesia is its high THC level, typically around the 20% mark, but also because it offers a body buzz as well as a euphoric high which makes for a great combination. It is reported that the high kicks in after around 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>This incredible Indica offers the best of both worlds - the legendary genetics of the original Northern Lights combined with the most recent advances in auto-flowering feminized cannabis strains.

<p>*NORTHERN LIGHTS FEMINIZED</p>

<p>As far back as the Eighties, Northern Lights was setting the standard by which other Indicas are still judged and she remains one of the most trusted names and sought-after varieties in modern cannabis culture. For many years, Northern Lights dominated the various harvest festivals, winning cup after cup, leading to more than one request that she be retired from competition in order to allow other strains a shot at the title. 
<br />With this new Northern Lights, the legendary Afghani Indica makes her debut as a feminized strain! With no need to identify and eliminate males, it’s never been easier to grow the definitive example of cannabis Indica - Northern Lights from Sensi Seeds.
<br />Like most of her family, Northern Lights Feminized is usually grown indoors, under lights, though this strain can also perform very well outdoors in a warm, sunny Mediterranean climate.
<br />Northern Lights Feminized continues the traditions of her classic ancestors; she produces fast, solid harvests with surprisingly little growing-odour. Nevertheless, her buds are sweetly fragrant and, due to their thick coating of THC-rich trichomes, remarkably powerful!</p>

<p>• Feminized : Yes
<br />• Autoflowering : No
<br />• Medical value : Moderate
<br />• Medical use : Mainly stress relief and anti depression.
<br />• Effect : Euphoric, happy and uplifting.
<br />• Lineage : Northern Lights #1
<br />• Genetics : Indica (80%) Sativa (20%)
<br />• Location : Indoor / Outdoor / Greenhouse
<br />• From seed 2 crop : ± 74 Days (± 11 weeks)
<br />• Flowering (indoor) : ± 60 Days (± 9 weeks)
<br />• Outdoor (harvest) : Late September
<br />• THC : High (18%)
<br />• CBD : Moderate
<br />• Yield (gr/m2) : Moderate (350/450)
<br />• Stature (cm) : Average (100/130)
<br />• Grow difficulty : Medium</p>

<p>*WHITE WIDOW AUTOFLOWER FEMINIZED</p>

<p>One of the most famous names in the Amsterdam coffeeshop scene, White Widow has held its own against newer strains for almost two decades! Building on the success of the regular and feminized versions, White Label has added an auto-flowering version to the family: White Widow Automatic. This powerhouse hybrid blends the 70% indica, 30% sativa composition of the original with carefully selected Ruderalis crosses to create a new variety with all the appeal and strength of the original, but now in a form that’s even easier to cultivate! </p>

<p>The advantages of auto-flowering strains for both indoor and outdoor growers are manifold. Light cycles and even light spectra cease to be a concern in either environment, as the plants will begin flowering at a certain point in their life cycle no matter what the ratio of hours of light to darkness is. Another special quality of this autoflowering cannabis seed strain is its ability to complete its flowering cycle undisturbed, even in a growing environment that would cause problems for regular and feminized strains - for example, one with irregular hours of light and darkness, or even considerable light pollution during the dark hours. </p>

<p>For White Widow Automatic, the first signs of flowering begin to show in the third or fourth week after germinating the autoflowering cannabis seeds. The flowering period continues for another six or so weeks, meaning that White Widow Automatic can go from seed to harvest in as little as 75 days. For outdoor growers in temperate to warm climates, this means the potential to harvest two crops from the same area during one summer; for indoor gardeners, three or even four crops per year could be achieved.</p>

<br />• Stature (cm) : Straight &amp; Stealthy (50/60)
<br />• Grow difficulty : Novice (Easy) </p>

<p>*WHITE WIDOW FEMINIZED</p>

<p>The backbone of the Dutch coffee-shop industry, the first of the "white weed" strains and an all-round commercial success story, White Widow is one of the most famous cannabis strains in modern growing. While this is partly due to her memorable name, her speed, yield and stunningly thick coating of trichomes have a lot more to do with it! Mostly-Indica, with sweet, thick, acrid smoke that imparts a hammering stone, White Widow is a major part of many visitors’ first experience of Amsterdam. White Widow grown from seed is very easy to clone, and is a good plant with which to perfect your technique. </p>

<p>*JACK HERER FEMINIZED</p>

<p>Jack Herer is known as one of the finest cannabis varieties ever created and is often referred to as the 'champagne of strains'. Jack Herer is therefore the Méthode Champagnoise of top-class cannabis hybrids. While not quite in the same league as the true elixir, she's far superior to 'sparkling white wine' and miles ahead of the various low quality 'Jack' copies. </p>

<p>Jack Herer is a subtle f2 variation on the original f1 strain, with parents selected from the award-wining JH gene pool. Phenotype variation remains quite large, with most examples leaning towards Sativa - tall, energetic, Hazey plants with fabulous resin production and an uplifting, almost psychedelic effect. 
<br />Females with very strong Sativa traits combined with good yield and manageable size are common among plants grown from these seeds, and such individuals should be preserved as mother plants by anyone who wishes to produce ganja that's as good as it gets. </p>
