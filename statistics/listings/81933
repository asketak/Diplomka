<p>How A Cash Panda Ticket Works
<br />1.  Each ticket is valid for 28 days (until it is automatically deleted from the email box)
<br />2.  All tickets that match 5/5, win.  The Jackpot will be equally divided among multiple winners.
<br />	A.  During the month of February, We will give the jackpot to whoever matches 4/5.  That 	increases your odds from 1/1370755 to 1/6687.
<br />3.  Each ticket is guaranteed valid for four draws even if there was another winner in the last drawings.
<br />4.  Cash Panda takes the numbers drawn from https://www.galottery.com/en-us/games/draw-games/fantasy-five.html#tab-winningNumbers 
<br />5.  Cash Panda only recognizes the numbers drawn on Friday nights.
<br />6.  When Cash Panda has a chance, he'll announce random drawings between those Fridays that he will use to increase all ticket holder's odds.  For example:  On Monday, Cash Panda may announce that he will honor a winning ticket for the following Tuesday's draw.  That gives all ticket holders four guaranteed draws, and a  bonus draw.  Cash Panda will try to do at least one bonus draw every two weeks.
<br />8.  Cash Panda only  recognizes the numbers drawn from the Georgia lottery Fantasy5.  It does not use the same rules as Fantasy5
<br />9.  Eligible tickets must be purchased at least 120 minutes prior to drawing at 11:30 (EST).  Anything purchased after that will be eligible for the following draw.</p>

<p>Why Play Cash Panda
<br />1.  You're feeling lucky
<br />2.  You have spare Bitcoins that aren't worth the exit fee
<br />3.  What else are you going to do with your change?
<br />4.  You don't want your bit coins to depreciate.
<br />5.  10% of all tickets sold will be donated to the Tor Project every time there is a winner..  A receipt of the donation will be displayed in the images.  Help us make the first donation.
<br />6.  You could win 1.6 Bitcoins with a $0.50 USD Lottery ticket..</p>

<p>How Redeem Your Winnings
<br />1.  If you got 5/5 numbers, we will  search all the numbers and announce how many winners there are.  We will not disclose user names.  4/5 for the month of Feb.
<br />3.  We will contact you with an encrypted message requesting a Bitcoin address to send your winnings.
<br />4.  Once we have the address, we will send 80% of your winnings to that address.
<br />5.  Cash Panda needs credibility to continue operation.  We will send the winner the final 20% of their winnings when they leave a review and rating.
