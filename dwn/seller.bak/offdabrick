<p>DNM HEROIN HAS A NEW FACE----AND THAT'S OFF DA BRICK!!!!</p>

<p>PLEASE finalize ur order the moment it arrives and checks out.</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>

<p>Q) What kind of #4 heroin does ODB sell?</p>

<p>A) Good question, I'm glad u asked. lol Well, I get this almost white tan coloured type and also an almost white very light grey type. Both types r on FIRE and I haven't gotten 1 complaint about my #4 source's goodies EVER. I have never once received a batch w/ fent from him. It's always solid as granite when I get it and cutting isn't my game. U get it how I get it. Quality over quantity any day 4 this guy! I only put premium gas in my car, so why would I put anything less then premium drugs in my body (vehicle)? I would expect u all 2 operate in a similar fashion. That being said, u will absodopely LOVE my #4. But don't take my word 4 it. Do some research. ;)</p>

<p>Thank u 4 checkin out my new store OFFDABRICK where EVERYTHING on deck is literally right off the kilo! No cutting, tampering, adding, subtracting, mixing, cooking, rerocking or any of that bullshit I've seen all over these darknet sites. This is the best cocaine available anywhere outside of South America, test it out 4 urself and u will be back 4 more! Also have a few other goodies like the best #4 heroin money can buy, 420 and CBD Isolate pills. What u see is what u get EVERY TIME and my supply is unlimited so yes I can keep it coming. Bulk orders send me a pm.</p>

<p>A few things 2 get out of the way-</p>

<p>U don't have a RIGHT 2 know the details on the day ur order will ship, so don't ask because I won't consider it bad customer service 2 ignore ur message if that's why u made me wait 4ever 4 the page 2 load just 2 see a question I ask u not 2 send me. It will ship within 48 hours (BUSINESS DAYS, so that is excluding holidays and days the PO is not open) of u submitting the order, if it doesn't u will hear from me BEFORE u get 2 ask about it.</p>

<p>If ur address is sent w/o being encrypted, u fucked up and ur order will be cancelled no questions asked so make sure u encrypt ur address and sensitive info as well, but DO NOT encrypt non-sensitive messages! If u can't use PGP then at LEAST use temp.pm, but whatever u do, DO NOT send ur address or other sensitive info unencrypted under ANY circumstances!</p>

<p>This DNM thingy works off feedback people. It doesn't have 2 be a page or 2 but it should always b more than "Enter ur comments here". If u don't leave me feedback, ur feedback from me will read something like "Good transaction, but fyi this buyer doesn't leave feedback.". ijs people should know the truth about how we all do business.</p>

<p>I will not discuss stealth or anything concerning methods of shipping in a convo online. I have researched and experienced enough 2 be a pro at this and everything I have sent so far has made it w/ no prob. A zip lock inside Vac seal is used, double-vac seal when necessary, and even mylar is available but only used when that stealth is required. For most USA 2 USA orders that don't go through customs 1 vac seal is MORE than enough.</p>

<p>Sample listings so u can try me out r up w/ limited time lower prices. Get it while u can!</p>

<p>Please message me BEFORE leavin less than 5 feedback if the issue can b fixed. I will assume less than 5 fb 2 mean we don't do biz anymore and that will be that.</p>

<p>NO I DO NOT send out free samples so please don't ask. I'm 2 busy 2 waste time sayin no.</p>

<p>WHEN ENCRYPTING UR ADDRESS IN ALL CAPS please follow these instructions:</p>

<p>U must use a FULL NAME, no first or last initials or only initials. A business name is okay, but a REAL person's full name is preferred. If u send a name w/ only a 1st or last initial ur order could be delayed while I write u 2 request a full name and time is needed 4 u 2 reply, so just do it right the 1st time.</p>

<p>Do not use any unnecessary punctuation in ur address such as periods (.) after abbreviations such as ST, DR or PL. The ONLY comma in ur address should b after the city name right b4 the zip code (which btw should contain 5 digits, a hyphen AND then the last FOUR digits which u can obtain at http://www.usps.com if u do not know urs. There should be 2 spaces between the state abbreviation and the zip-code. So ur address should look something like this:</p>

<p>OFF D BRICK
<br />420 COLA ST  APT 69
<br />CANNABICITY, CA  42042-0420</p>

<p>PLEASE follow these simple addressing instructions cuz it will gr8ly speed up my ability 2 serve u.</p>
