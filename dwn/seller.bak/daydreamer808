<p>WE ARE READY TO SHIP SAME DAY...</p>

<p>hello, we are here and ready to ship</p>

<p>contact us if you have any questions or  for custom order information</p>

<p>_________________________________________</p>

<p>NO DELIVERY IS GUARANTEED ON A SPECIFIC DATE.
<br />ONLY ESTIMATES ARE GIVEN BY POSTAL SERVICE* check with USPS.COM. 
<br />WE DO OUR BEST TO GET YOUR ORDER PROCESSED AND SHIPPED ASAP.
<br />WE KNOW YOU WANT YOUR ORDER, BE PATIENT IT WILL ARIVE</p>

<p>-----------------------------GENERAL RULES---------------------------------</p>

<p>1. All communication must be encrypted with PGP, or one of the following</p>

<p>	www.torsms.com
<br />	www.tmwsd.ws
<br />	www.temp.pm
<br />	www.privnote.com</p>

<p> Tutorials in the Forum.</p>

<p>2. Read the ENTIRE listing before purchasing.</p>

<p>3. Prices are subject to daily change due to a multitude of factors. This means that if you buy a product from us, the price could be higher or lower the next day. This will not effect your order, and has nothing to do with you. It's not a conspiracy.</p>

<p>4. Be polite. We APPRECIATE your business, but we do not NEED it.</p>

<p>5. PLEASE, Be patient. Read our Shipping Section.</p>

<p>-----------------------------SHIPPING RULES--------------------------------</p>

<p>1. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE BELOW GUIDELINES BEFORE ORDERING. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE BELOW GUIDELINES WILL MAKE YOU INELLIGIBLE FOR A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT IN THE EVENT OF A LOST PACKAGE.</p>

<p>2. I check orders once per da, 24hours. Once received, the order status will be changed to "SHIPPED". Handling time is then 1-2 days, and the packages are shipped ASAP, after they have been processed.  The orders then TYPICALLY arrive 3-5 days later. Also, WE DO NOT SHIP ON WEEKENDS. So, for example, if you place an order Thursday, IT MAY NOT BE SHIPPED UNTIL MONDAY. You should also keep in mind that some packages may be delayed due to misrouting by the carrier, and can occasionally take longer to arrive. I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO RESPOND TO MESSAGES ABOUT SHIPPING TIMES UNLESS THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED "LATE" BY THE ABOVE GUIDLINES. Please do the math before you message me.</p>

<p>3. YOU MUST USE A LEGITIMATE SHIPPING ADDRESS AND A LEGITIMATE NAME WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SHIPPING ADDRESS. Most packages that don't arrive are due to the fact that the shipping information does not match the true name and address. You will have no chance of a refund/re-ship if you do not follow this step.</p>

<p>4. YOU MUST GIVE US YOUR ADDRESS -- !!!ENCRYPTED!!!</p>

<p>IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:</p>

<p>YOUR NAME
<br />123 N YOUR ST.
<br />APT# 1
<br />CITY, ST 00000-0000</p>

<p>5. Use PGP encryption for your shipping info (and all communications you have with us). This is critical for your own safety and security! If you are not familiar with PGP encryption, please search the forums for one of the many simple, user-friendly tutorials. AS MENTIONED ABOVE</p>

<p>6. We have added "COMBINED SHIPPING" as we have requests for multiple orders. If you mis use the option we will go back to the old way.  The only way to pick the combined shipping option is if you have already PAID for one shipping method, we will CANCEL ANY AND ALL ORDERS that dont use this option correctly... or just short the product in the order to make up the difference...</p>

<p>-----------------------------REFUND/RE-SHIP POLICY-------------------------</p>

<p>1. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PACKAGES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN DELIVERED! IF TRACKING STATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN DELIVERED, AND YOU THEN CLAIM THAT YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE IT, WE WILL NOT ISSUE A REFUND OR RE-SHIP. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO ASSUME LIABILITY IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEONE ELSE STEALS YOUR PACKAGE AFTER IT'S BEEN DELIVERED.</p>

<p>2. FOLLOW OUR SHIPPING GUIDELINES! If you fail to do so, you will be inelligible for a refund or replacement. If you follow our shipping policy, your package will arrive.</p>

<p>3. Our methods are discrete and professional, and are proven to work. If for whatever your package does not arrive, please send us a message before leaving a review. WE WILL CORRECT HUMAN ERROR, ON OUR PART, at our discretion. On a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Ships To</p>

<p>North America</p>
