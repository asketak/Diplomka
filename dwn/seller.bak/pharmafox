<p>Welcome to PharmaFox, the pharmacy full of all the great meds you need, no prescription necessary. Please read as you will find all the information you need about ordering and what to expect. There is also a FAQ section. Please check this out to see if your question is covered before you PM. If you PM with a question already covered in the FAQ, I will not respond. </p>

<p>_______________________________________________________
<br />ORDERING &amp; SHIPPING </p>

<p>►All orders are shipped US to US domestic only.</p>

<p>►Shipping times:</p>

<p>I don't have any particular time during the day to insure same day shipping. Sometimes I get started late, or finish early. I can only guarantee orders will be shipped out within 24 hours except for Sundays or holidays. Priority shipping is 2 to 3 days depending on where you are. First class is always 3 days. </p>

<p>►All orders are tracked. Once your order is marked "Shipped", you will receive a privnote in the order details containing your tracking number. Don't lose it because if you do, I will not look it up for you again, so don't ask. </p>

<p>►Please use the following format when sending your address:</p>

<p>Name Here
<br />Address Line 1
<br />Address Line 2
<br />City, State
<br />Zip code</p>

<p>►Please use your real name and double check your address before sending it to me.</p>

<p>►Please encrypt shipping information, as well as any other sensitive data. You can encrypt via my PGP public key, or use privnote. Any order containing unencrypted shipping information will be canceled. </p>

<p>►FE- Listings are 50% FE. This means 50% of the BTC which goes into escrow when you click order, is released to me automatically when I mark the order "shipped". Please be sure to finalize the remaining 50% of the payment upon receipt of order. 
<br />_______________________________________________________
<br />REFUND POLICY &amp; FEEDBACK</p>

<p>►It is important to note, if you order, my job is simply to make sure the order gets to the address specified by you. Beyond that, the rest is up to you. If the tracking information says the order was delivered, I consider my job to be done. </p>

<p>►I don't reship to an address where a previous order has been lost or seized. </p>

<p>►Refunds are issued if your parcel is lost or seized.</p>

<p>►In the event you're unsatisfied with your experience, please contact us immediately. We are all about good business and we want to make sure each and every situation is made right.</p>

<br />FAQ</p>

<p>I'm noob friendly, but only to a certain point. If you have a legit question, I will try to help. But if you PM with something I think you can figure out on your own if you just make the effort, I'm not going to respond. I'm not going to hold your hand. This is a really simply thing. You order, I ship. Everyday my inbox is full of PM's with questions like these, and I just don't have the time or patience to continue addressing each one. If you don't see your question here, you can PM me. But please, try to help me out and figure it out on your own first. There is plenty of information on encryption, security, and everything else you need to know on the forums. Try looking there first. </p>

<p>►Can you ship internationally?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>►When will I get my order?</p>

<p>2 to 3 days after it ships.</p>

<p>►When will my order ship?</p>

<p>Within 24 hours of when you order. </p>

<p>►Can you send me a tracking number?</p>

<p>Yes, it's in your order details encrypted via privnote. </p>

<p>►Can you send me a tracking number encrypted with my PGP public key?</p>

<p>No, I encrypt tracking numbers with privnote, I'm not changing just for you. </p>

<p>►Can you send Priority Express?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>►Why did my order get canceled? </p>

<p>You either chose the combined option and didn't pay for shipping (most common reason), your shipping information was not encrypted, or you don't leave enough feedback effectively showing me you don't finalize orders and I'm going to have to wait for auto finalize to get paid. If you don't finalize on time, please go elsewhere. Furthermore, if you make me wait for auto finalize, you will be blacklisted. So finalize your orders. </p>

<p>►The tracking says, "delivered" but nothing is here. What should I do?</p>

<p>I will probably answer this, but don't be surprised if I'm curt about it. As I stated in Ordering, if the tracking says, "delivered," I did my job. I don't know what you should do beyond that. Maybe you got the address wrong. Maybe the drop is not secure. Maybe the postman made a mistake. I really don't know. I just ship the packages. I have no control of them once they travel. </p>

<p>►Can you make it so my order arrives on a certain day? I don't want my roommates to get it. </p>

<p>No, I can't. Again, this is not my problem. It's your job to make sure your drop is secure and can effectively receive packages. I'm only responsible for packages that are lost during travel. Once they reach their destination, they're your responsibility. </p>

<p>►The package was delivered, but only a slip was left in my box. What should I do? </p>

<p>First thing, finalize you order if you haven't. After that, I don't know. Go get your package, or don't, I don't know. Do whatever you want to do. My job is done at this point. </p>

<p>►The store seems different. Are you the same PharmaFox from before?</p>

<p>Yes, it's still me, the one, the only, PharmaFox. There has only ever been one, and that's not changing anytime soon. </p>

<p>►You seem like kind of a dick from what I remember. Are you sure you're the same PharmaFox from before?</p>

<p>Lol, yes it's still me, and no I'm not a dick. I'm still as kind and courteous as I've always been. It's just that if you knew how much time I spend a day answering questions just like these, you'd understand why I can't help but sound a little condescending in the FAQ section. Seriously, if you have a legit question, hit me up and I'll try to help. Just please try not to waste my time. </p>

<p>Thanks,
<br />PF
