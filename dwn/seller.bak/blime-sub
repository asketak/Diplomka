<p>
this is a 1 -person operation and i do my best to provide the best possible service as is evident by the feedback i have built. I</p>

<p>1) if you order first class mail for shipping there is no reshipment if your order doent arrive for some reason(I have had  only 1 order out of all my orders claim non arrival and it was under suspicious circumstances)). I may still reship but it will be under my discretion i have removed most of the first class mail options as people abuse the system and dispute  claiming they never got it. this is impossible to have a rate 5-6x higher for non-arrivals of first class over priority. stop being greedy motherfuckers. funny thing is i can tell who is doing this too, as they are usually acting all angry they didnt get their package while the legit ones are polite, ask proper questions and dont demand a reship.</p>

<p>2) for large international orders(over $400) I will not  guarantee reship non-arrivals even if you got tracking . If anything in these situations I may reship up to 50% depnding on the situation. What I will do is package the order to your specifications to the dot that way its your responsibility to pick packaging which will make it through customs.</p>

<p>3) orders placed before 1pm EST(10am PST) will usuallly ship out the same day, but i cant guarantee it if there is a large backlog</p>

<p>4) your order will be marked as shipped when i process it, it may not be shipped until the following day, as i process them at night usually. if you want a tracking number, you must request it at time of order with your address, and finalize your order upon getting the tracking number. i cannot get you tracking after the fact and the only way you will get it is if you claim non-delivery and it shows otherwise. </p>

<p>5) for overnight orders, please do not contact me about your order not arriving unless 5 days have passed for priority shipping or 3 days have passed for overnight. usps makes mistakes/delays sometimes. yes they have a guaranteed delivery for overnight, but all that means is they refund u shipping cost. once a product is in the mail i have no more control.</p>

<p>6) if i dont reply to your msg within 24-36 hours, send another. i get tons of messages and miss some sometimes.</p>

<p>7) avoid going into disupute, you will have a much nicer vendor to deal with. and "it was going to autofinalize" is not an excuse. if you trust me with products you put into your body, you should be able to trust i wont jack you for a hundred dollars. disputes are a big fuck you to me as they mean that i was not willing to work with you and anyone who claims this is full of shit as i make every effort to leave customers happy</p>

<p>8) *IMPORTANT* you require tracking, i will share it as long as its requested at time of order and you finalize the order once you get the tracking number(within 12 hours of getting it, fail to do this and your orders will no longer be accepted here, i dont care how much you spend, if we dont have mutual trust i cant work with you.).  I cannot provide you tracking after the fact as it is stored in a fashion which would take me 10-30 minutes to retrieve. tracking numbers are only kept for 2 weeks at which point they are no longer available at all.  IF you did not request tracking when ordering you will not get it, at best I will check your order status after a no-show of 4 business days for overnight from day of shipping, and 8 business days for priority(a lot of times the actual day of shipment is the day after its marked shipped unless marked shipped that day in notes or you requested the same day shipping and i said it made it).  I will not check your tracking before these time periods expire and if you put it into dispute I will check tracking and at best provide it to the moderator and ban you from my shop(though i will probably issue your miniscule refund so you can't leave a negative feedback like some assholes after i give them a portion of their money back, its not worth it to keep half of $100 to get some bullshit feedback by some dumb dipshit who has no respect).</p>

<p>Lastly, if you have any questions feel free to ask, but keep in mind i am very overloaded with inquiries so keep them to things you cant figure out yourself and dont ask about your order status unless the time periods above have passed. For fraud related items, dont ask how to use the products unless you are paying for tutorials. for drugs, dont ask me how to use them, there are many websites that cover this. bluelight.ru is a great resource/community where your questions can be answered.  i will not respond to questions about if your order went out anymore. if its marked shipped it went out today or tomorrow depending on the time. </p>

<p>**NOTE - DO NOT PGP ENCRYPT YOUR MESSAGES WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN SENSATIVE INFO SUCH AS YOUR ADDRESS. YOU DO NOT NEED TO ENCRYPT A MESSAGE TELLING ME YOU INTEND TO ORDER 2 GRAMS OF SOMETHING. IT WASTES MY TIME AND PREVENTS ME FROM ANSWERING EVERY INQUIRY I HAVE</p>

<p>***NOTE NOTE NOTE - IF I DONT REPLY TO A MESSAGE I AM NOT IGNORING YOU, I PROBABLY DID NOT SEE IT,  IF YOU HAVE NO REPLY WITHIN 24-36 hours send me another message in the same thread so its bumped to the top of my list, DO NOT START A NEW THREAD. IF its absolutly urgent, send me a message if no reply in 12 hours.  I try to reply to everyone within 24 hours in general</p>

<p>***NOTE I would be willing to trade product for the following items - Amazon giftcards, best buy giftcards, visa giftcards, Carded high end laptops(I have a drop to ship to until the end of the month</p>

<p>***Note : I do offer bulk pricing most of my products. the fentynal has great bulk pricing if you piggyback onto my order and pay 7 days in advance when i plce my order. then i send it out soon as i get it. usually takes 6-7 days from day you pay to day u get your order.
