<br />Housekeeping – CashPanda has moved from AlphaBay to Valhalla following the recent AlphaBay scandal.  We strive to honor the players who put faith in us and bought tickets.  Let us know what your user name was at that site and what ticket numbers you gave us and we will reactivate them (free of charge) for an entire month.
<br />Due to high volumes of ticket sales and the universally accepted nature of games such as this, there will be no refunds.  If you reasonably feel that we owe you honest compensation, feel free to contact us via encrypted message.</p>

<p>Every $0.50 USD Cash Panda Lotto Ticket Gives you more than eight chances at winning the 1.6 BITCOIN JACKPOT.  Simply select the amount of tickets you would like to buy and enter the ticket numbers you would like to play-per the ticket buying guidelines below.  We check winning numbers every Friday and Saturday and do bonus draws whenever possible.  A donation to the Tor Project is made every time there is a winner.  What else are you going to do with your change?  Let's play,

<p>How To Play And Win Cash Panda Bitcoin Lottery
<br />1.  Each ticket costs $0.50 USD
<br />2.  Select quantity of tickets you would like to purchase.  You may buy as many as you'd like.
<br />3.  Select five numbers between 1-42 and put them in the Notes section.
<br />4.  For each ticket, list the five numbers with a space between each. Ex: 08 12 30 31 36,
<br />5.  List numbers 1-9 with a zero in front.  Ex: 01 02 05 06 09
<br />6.  List the numbers within each ticket in chronological order.
<br />7.  If purchasing multiple tickets, list each ticket on a single line and put a comma at the end of each ticket number.  :Example below for three tickets purchased.</p>

<p>02 06 11 22 36,
<br />09 13 25 29 42,
<br />01 13 25 28 31,</p>

<p>8.  List only numbers.
<br />9.  Do not encrypt.  There is no personally identifiable or compromising information.  The large volume of tickets cannot be unlocked and searched at a timely pace.  If you win, we will contact you with an encrypted message to congratulate you and to obtain the Bitcoin address to which you would like to have your jackpot sent.
<br />11.  Follow guidelines so that winning tickets may be easily searched and awarded.</p>

<p>How A Cash Panda Ticket Works
<br />1.  Each ticket is valid for 28 days (until it is automatically deleted from the email box)
<br />2.  All tickets that match 5/5, win.  The Jackpot will be equally divided among multiple winners.
<br />3.  Each ticket is guaranteed valid for eight draws even if there was another winner since your original purchase.
<br />4.  Cash Panda takes the numbers drawn from https://www.galottery.com/en-us/games/draw-games/fantasy-five.html#tab-winningNumbers 
<br />5.  Cash Panda only recognizes the numbers drawn on Friday and Saturday nights.
<br />6.  When Cash Panda has a chance, he'll announce random drawings between those Fridays and Saturdays that he will use to increase all ticket holder's odds.  For example:  On Monday, Cash Panda may announce that he will honor a winning ticket for the following Tuesday's draw.  That gives all ticket holders eight guaranteed draws, and a  bonus draw.  Cash Panda will try to do at least one bonus draw every two weeks.
<br />8.  Cash Panda recognizes only the numbers drawn from the Georgia lottery Fantasy5.  It does not use the same rules as Fantasy5
<br />9.  Eligible tickets must be purchased at least 120 minutes prior to drawing at 11:30 (EST).  Anything purchased after that will be eligible for the following draw.</p>

<p>Why Play Cash Panda
<br />1.  You're feeling lucky
<br />2.  You have spare Bitcoins that aren't worth the exit fee
<br />3.  What else are you going to do with your change?
<br />4.  You don't want your bit coins to depreciate.
<br />5.  10% of all tickets sold will be donated to the Tor Project every time there is a winner..  A receipt of the donation will be displayed in the images.  Help us make the first donation.
<br />6.  You could win 1.6 Bitcoins with a $0.50 USD Lottery ticket..</p>

<p>How Redeem Your Winnings
<br />1.  If you got 5/5 numbers, we will  search all the numbers and announce how many winners there are.  We will not disclose user names.
<br />3.  We will contact you with an encrypted message requesting a Bitcoin address to send your winnings.
<br />4.  Once we have the address, we will send 80% of your winnings to that address.
<br />5.  Cash Panda needs credibility to continue operation.  We will send the winner the final 20% of their winnings when they leave a review and rating.  Once a review has been posted, we will contact you with an encrypted message requesting Bitcoin address to pay out the final 20% of your winnings.
