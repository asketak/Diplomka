<p>9/2 sold out</p>

<p>8/30  OK so by popular demand and lack of sale I'm opening up a listing or Penis Envy in ounce quantity. You asked for you got it. Once again I ship out all orders within 24 hours. All current orders have shipped. Also currently harvesting cheapass shrooms and will be listing a few offerings in the next coming days. Cheap shrooms will be back in full force in two weeks.</p>

<p>WHY SO CHEAP?</p>

<p>I have been asked why are my shrooms so much cheaper than other vendors' shrooms. It's simple, I want to sell out fast. I would rather sell out in three days for less money than grind for weeks or months at a time trying to get top dollar. Just growing these shrooms is practically a full time job and I also have a job irl too. </p>

<p>What does this mean for buyers? If you want these shrooms you need to act fast because my listings (by design) will not last more than a few days and I will not wait for you. In time I will be getting more and more selective of who I sell to (see preferred buyers section).  </p>

<p>QUARTER POUNDS ONLY</p>

<p>I only do QPs for two reasons. It's easier for me to organize and manage orders if they're all the same quantity. And there is no way to mail a larger quantity without walking into the PO. </p>

<p>There is a STRICT limit of one QP per address per week. I will not send more than one pack to the same address in a single week's time. This is the rule, familiarize yourself with it, get over it, I will not break this rule for anyone and I do not fucking care how many shrooms you can move for me. I will not answer any messages about shipping more than one QP per address per week. </p>

<p>Please do NOT ask about getting an ounce or two ounces or sending larger packs. Messages about this will be ignored.</p>

<p>FE, TRACKING NUMBERS, AND DD</p>

<p>I do not yet have FE privledges on AlphaBay or DreamMarket. If you would like to voluntarily FE after your order is shipped I will gladly send your tracking number as a thank you. If you want this make sure you make your public key is available to me. I will not send tracking unecrypted or in privnote. </p>

<p>SHIPPING</p>

<p>USPS priority mail only. I ship everyday monday thru friday (no saturday shipping). All orders will ship out within 24 hours (except sat). Cut of time for same day shipping is 9am CDT. I SHIP AS FAST AS I CAN. </p>

<p>If I mark the order 'shipped' it has been shipped. If for some reason the order was marked shipped and was not actually shipped I will notify you when it actually ships. USPS priority mail takes 2 days transit to 90% of lower 48 addresses. Occationally packs take 3 or 4 days, rarely 5 days. If your pack has been in transit for more than five days (mon-sat) please contact me immediately. </p>

<p>AUTO-FINALIZERS AND PREFERRED BUYERS</p>

<p>I ship as fast as I can which makes auto-finalizers particularly infuriating. At the moment I have limited options to combat these fuckers. If you HOLD ESCROW FOR MORE THAN 48 HOURS OF DELIVERY your right to escrow is gone. If you auto-finalize your order regardless of why I will ban your buyer account entirely and future orders to the same city will need to FE or DD. You will effectively ruin the privledge of escrow for your entire city if you auto-finalize. Don't be an asshole.</p>

<p>CONTACT</p>

<p>This is my anonymous email, please make sure all sensitive communications are encrypted GS9513@muchomail.com</p>

<p>I am on DreamMarket, oasis, vahalla and AlphaBay as CHEAPASSBULKSHROOMS</p>
