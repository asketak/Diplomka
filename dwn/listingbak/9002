<br />Hiya! This is a free listing containing up to date links to all the authentic invite-only marketplaces worth using.</p>

<p>But, to make things a bit more interesting.. I came up with an idea that might just be crazy enough to work.</p>

<p>I'm going to pay you everytime you make a purchase on the DNM simply for using my referral links (this doesnt detract anything from you).</p>

<p>Basically, when a user signs up using a referral link, the inviter gets a cut of the profits of the market from that particular user. (It varies from market to market, but is usually substantial. Some markets pay up to 40% of all fees/cut taken back for the entite life of the account! The reason they do this is to get more customers. If they have people like me advertising their market they will get more customers and thus more profit.</p>

<p>This is why the best markets need a referral to sign up, so either way, you can use my referral link and have some of your bitcoin sent back to you twice a month from it, or use someone elses and get nothing. Join up with our team and take a bit back from the dark net ;)</p>

<p>"How much will I earn?"
<br />I will pay you 25% of the referral/affiliate bitcoin from that market on a fortnightly basis. Once your account has at least 3 items ordered the reward goes up to 50%! This in effect means you automatically get a discount on every item you buy :)</p>

<p>It gets better though. For each user that you send to me that ends up earning affiliate bitcoins, i will also pay YOU a massive 20% of what THEY earn. In addition to this, your bonus will go up to 30%/60% depending on if you have made 3 purchases or not. Simply have them mention your username, or you can tell me it yourself.</p>

<p>Basically, it's win-win-win: I get extra referral bitcoin, you get a discount on all items purchased, you earn an additional discount on purchases + passive bitcoin for anyone you register through me, the market gets an additional user.</p>

<p>On the 1st and 15th of each month, I will automatically pay out your bitcoin. Just send me an email once at darknetaffiliates@lelantos.org with your bitcoin address, your username you used to sign up as an affiliate, so that i can cross check your purchases with your affiliate money. The more you buy from your account, the more bitcoin you get refunded.</p>

<p>Please check out my store for Australian Dexamphetamine! I am vending on Abraxas, Silkkitie, Alphabay and Nucleus all under the same vendor name, check out my Grams vendor sumary page to check out my reviews at http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/infodesk/vendor/0xA14F3CB82FC48900</p>

<p>I look forward to sending out all of your bi-weekly payments! =D Lets work together by then sharing it on to your friends so we both can get the most out of the dark net markets automatic bitcoin payouts!!</p>

<p>To guarantee that I am not a scammer myself, before you sign up to any market, please feel free to go visit the market specific forum or subreddit listed below and check the sidebar on the right to cross check the market link to ensure that what comes before .onion is the same.</p>

<p>I say this because there are MANY phishing scams on the DNM's and i just want to run a legitimite business here. If you are new to this scene you MUST remember to be vigilant in checking your .onion links.</p>
