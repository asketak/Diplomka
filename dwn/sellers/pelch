<p>UPDATE: 13/01. Heyyy acid lovers, i'm back and ready to deal, come get some of the good shit.</p>

<p>29/04 Restocked on the 98% pure Kesey acid, very happy with the 100% positive feedback across all markets that I sell on. If you want the purest acid you can find 99-99.5% pure, go with the Elephant or Hanuman tabs, which is why they are more expensive.</p>

<p>Don't fall for other vendors tricks. The reason they can go so low with prices is because under dosing tabs is endemic on the dark net, some sell research chemicals as acid, or they hit you with big postage costs and hope you don’t notice.</p>

<p>With me you get quality acid, at or a little over or around the dosage you are paying for, and all delivered next day within the UK. </p>

<p>Some of my competitor vendors have been around as long as me, but you wouldn’t know it as they exit scammed under previous names and set up fresh accounts. I have been operating on the dark net since the beginning of 2013 under one name and I will continue to run a professional and efficient service as I always have.</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely, Petch
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>To any new buyers i have 5000 previous sales on Agora with a feedback rating of 4.98 out of 5.00. Here is my Grams profile to feast your eyes on, http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/infodesk/vendor/0x9399796EED5CC99F</p>

<p>Following the lead of a couple of other vendors i am now donating 1% of sales to Free Ross since he's unjustly doing a double life sentence, despite his arrest and the conduct of the law enforcement being illegal.</p>

<p>http://freeross.org </p>

<p>I'm now in partnership with Markovich, so you can get that sought after Dutch Xtal with UK Next Day Delivery from myself, or if you are in a country that Markovich doesn't send too, you can get it sent from the UK. (except the USA/Israel)Order at own risk from outside EU, no refunds/re-sends.</p>

<p>***Cut off time for Next Day Delivery is 2PM***</p>

<p>I am an experienced grower and connoisseur of cannabis, selling a small, but consistent amount of cannabis exclusively on Dream. The rest I sell to a small network of friends. All cannabis is grown hydroponically and with due care, it is not over fertilised and has been allowed to dry and cure.</p>

<p>All cannabis and hashish orders are vacuum sealed, and I also use MBB bags, making the parcel smell proof, so you can order with peace of mind.</p>

<p>All deliveries are sent by Royal Mail First Class post.</p>

<p>I do not insist that you use PGP, that's up to you, but it is for your protection. If you don't use PGP, you can send your name and address by normal text, or you can use</p>

<p>http://sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion</p>

<p>-No FE Early Necessary FOR BUYERS WITH 5 PLUS DEALS-*  (No longer applicable)</p>

<p>Please make it easy to copy and paste your address by having capital letters where needed, titles, and make sure you add a name, as it looks suspicious to have no name to go with the address. In the UK the address format should look like this:</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Marley
<br />192 Jamaica Avenue
<br />London
<br />SE11 2EA</p>

<p>Make sure you put a space in between the postcode, not doing so can increase the likelihood of your order not arriving, so SE112EA looks wrong, and could be the difference between you receiving your order or not, SE11 2EA is how it should be.</p>

<p>***Cut off time for Next day delivery is 2PM***</p>

<p>***I don't do custom deals, and don't respond to messages asking for them.</p>

<p>Estimate shipping times:</p>

<p>Europe: Within 7 days.</p>

<p>UK: 1/2 Working Days max/ 90% Next Day</p>

<p>International: Within 14 days</p>

<p>- Any orders made After 2pm on Friday, and any time Saturday or Sunday will be shipped on Monday -</p>

<p>REFUNDS</p>

<p>My new refund policy is a half reship or half refund to regular customers only. You must have a minimum of over five successful trades with me to qualify. Order at your own risk.</p>

<p>Amendment: I may consider a half refund/reship to buyers with a good buying history on Dream, a good amount of deals 25+ and positive feedback 5+ will be taken in to consideration.</p>

<p>Beware that i offer no reships or refunds to university accomodation addresses/mail forwarding addressees, or to buyers that don't put their name on the order, no exceptions.</p>
