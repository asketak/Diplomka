<p>Hello everyone at Valhalla!! We are Purex, a trusted vendor on dream market with over 200 positive bits of feedback from our returning buyers who trust our fantastic service time and time again :D </p>

<p>We are live on the darkweb 5 hours a day 7 days a week looking for new custom and now we have built up a reputable client line on DREAM and are looking to expand. To us at Purex, customer sevice and proffessionalism comes as priority. We are not greedy, we do not work on here for the numbers, customer satisfaction and communication comes first. If we have a problem, it is resolved!! Our service is flawless, our products are the best - We aim to please every single person we do business with! </p>

<p>Our product;</p>

<p>Pure Bolivian Cocaine.
<br />What we have here is some top of the range Cocaine, straight from the brick. Pure white in colour and an unbelievable organic smell, this Cocaine is extremely potent, great tasting and brings a fantastic feeling of euphoria and packs a serious punch! Straight from our source in South America, we beleive we have a real golden gem that is worth sharing! What you shall receive is exactly how we get it, with it passing through fewer hands than much of the Cocaine that comes via Europe - we believe you get an unbelievable product at a competetive rate!
<br />- If you require larger orders, please PGP message us. Extremely competitive prices!!</p>

<p>Columbian Cocaine.
<br />We have our Columbian cocaine- straight from the brick this batch coming from Columbia is container shipped to us. Our supplier at the source is in control of logistics so this passes through 1 or two hands before it gets to us. Being our cheaper option our Columbian flake lab tests at 78 percent and above every single time and hits highs of 85% so still in our opinion, stronger than anything you will find on the dark markets. Visually it comes white with a shiney glint and has a potent smell, in texture it is soft and oily. It is a smooth snort and packs a punch - not quite as powerfully as the Bolivian, but - for the price, the Euphoria experienced whilst under the influence of our Columbian is SECOND TO NONE and a lot of our customers  opt for this choice!!
<br /> 
<br />We welcome all new custom and thank everyone for their interest in our products. Please read some of our terms and conditions and a few other bits of important information that will answer a few of your questions :D </p>

<p>Shipping...</p>

<p>All orders will be processed and shipped within 24 hours, most cases it will be the same day. All domestic orders will be posted with a simple stamp on that will come through your letterbox. No tracking is available for small orders.</p>

<p>International...</p>

<p>Again all orders will be processed and shipped within 24 hours, all international orders will be sent tracked. If you require your item not tracked please message us before even placing your order to make sure we can do this to your country.

<p>Packaging...</p>

<p>Obviously we don't want to go into too much detail regarding this, but all items will be sent vacuum sealed and inside aluminium moisture bags.</p>

<p>1.Domestic: As standard, items will be sent in a small flat envelope (disguised with stealth) that will be similar to a business letter. Larger weights will be disguised and packaged differently. But will still fit through your letter box.</p>

<p>2.International: As standard, items will be sent with extreme stealth. Different methods will be used to discreetly hide your product within a legitimate item. (As per your request, we can also send in a small flat envelope if you prefer, which again will be with stealth)</p>

<p>         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />	</p>

<p>Refunds / Re-Ships...</p>

<p>No refund or reship will be given to anyone with under 5 positive bits of feedback, sorry to all you genuine folk but this is to prevent scamming.</p>

<p>All refunds and reships will be sorted on a case by case basis. It is highly unlikely your domestic post will not show up due to being 'lost' - being realistic this just doesn't happen!</p>

<p>Our policy will be to re-ship or refund a product after 10 working days of a no show, under no circumstance will anything be dealt with under this time frame. The amount re-fundable or available for a re-ship will be 50%.. As we have costs to cover also.</p>

<p>International: Again a refund and or re-ship shall only be given if this can be proven via a seizure letter. As all items will be tracked, this shall be investigated thoroughly if your item has been delivered or not.</p>

<p>         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>

<p>Payment...</p>

<p>All payments must be made in Bitcoin, no exceptions. Please do not message us asking otherwise. This is the safest option for both parties.</p>

<p>We are more than happy to use the escrow system as it gives peace of mind to you the buyer! Please do remember that the Bitcoin can be extremely volotile, this, for us vendors can wipe out any profit margin and also put us at a loss in a matter of seconds. Once you have received your product - if you can finalise as soon as possible it would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>

<p>Feedback...</p>

<p>Please leave feedback once you have received your product and you are happy with it. Any questions regarding anything to do with your product please get in touch as soon as possible. We are more than happy to address any issues and resolve them. Our main goal as a seller is to ensure the customer is happy. If you don't let us know, we can't help.</p>

<p>         - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
