<p>We are TWO WOLVES, the new &amp; old kids on the block.
<br />2 WOLVES – highest quality &amp; lowest prices</p>

<p>Please read our complete profile before placing an order.</p>

<p>Who we are:
<br />A veteran who's coming back from a year and a half long vacation, fed up with the performance of most vendors, we decided to use our long time experience to provide again the service the community deserves. High quality product for competitive prices, innovative stealth, honest and result orientated customer service are just a few of our benchmarks.</p>

<p>Our philosophy is customer before coin, which means we will always try to provide the best customer service possible and are willing to go the extra mile in order to satisfy you.</p>

<p>Happy ordering, you won't regret it! </p>

<p>Terms of Service
<br />SAFETY &amp; SECURITY
<br />We know that customers trust us with their safety and will honor this responsibility .
<br />That's why we take extra care when it comes to:</p>

<p>✔ Safety &gt;all listings are available with full escrow too!</p>

<p>✔ Sensitive date &gt; all addresses are deleted right after the order has been processed. For tracked orders we will only save a custom code,a zip code, country and the username not your full address like many other vendors do.</p>

<p>✔ Stealth &gt; Low profile in order to blend in with regular business mail, but designed to pass an inspection in the unlikely event of a seizure.
<br />&gt; Vacuum&amp;heat sealed MBBs for all orders.
<br />&gt; Return addresses are frequently rotated to minimize profiling in the unlikely event of a seizure.</p>

<p>✔ Drops We ship from Germany, using multiple hubs, in order to prevent profiling and to avoid the “scarlet NL flag”.</p>

<p>SUPPORT
<br />Communication is what differs a good from a great vendor. That's why customer service will always have the highest priority to us.</p>

<p>✔Response time &gt;all messages will be answered within 36hrs max.</p>

<p>✔ Questions &gt;there is no stupid question, only stupid answers.</p>

<p>✔ Politeness &gt;we will always treat our customers with respect and in a friendly manner.
<br />It's not your problem if we are busy, therefore we will always do our best to make you feel welcome.</p>

<p>✔ Bargains &gt;you are a few satoshi short to place an order with us. Message us and we will be happy to setup a (reasonably) discount custom listing for you.</p>

<p>We expect our customers to treat us in the same respectful way, we treat them.
<br />Insulting us, virtual screaming a.k.a. Capslock and rudeness in general will not be accepted.</p>

<p>SHIPPING
<br />Orders are shipped 3-4 times a week on rotating non-consecutive days.
<br />ALL orders are shipped from different, rotating hubs in Germany.
<br />We ship worldwide excluding Australia, Scandinavia, France, New Zealand, Italy and domestic Germany.</p>

<p>Average shipping time to your destination:</p>

<p>EU/ East Asia 2 to 10 days
<br />USA 7 to 17 days
<br />Rest of World 10 to 30 days</p>

<p>These are only average shipping times, counting from the day the order was dispatched.
<br />As we all know, shipping times can vary, depending on the weather, holidays in the country of origin/ destination, postal strikes, or mailman George simply having a bad day because his DNM order hasn't made it yet. So please bear in mind, that a few days less or extra are always possible, and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>ADDRESS
<br />Please make sure to double check your address before placing the order, this will save you and us a lot of wasted time. Orders that cannot be delivered due to a wrong address will not be refunded.</p>

<p>Please make sure to post your address in the exact way it should be printed on the label.
<br />We will only copy and paste the details you provided.</p>

<p>If you are unsure how to write your address correctly, please visit
<br />https://www.informatica.com/products/data-quality/data-as-a-service/address-verification/address-formats.html</p>

<p>NO FAKE NAMES OR FAKE COMPANIES, NEVER USE A DROP WITHOUT THE OWNER'S CONSENT!!!</p>

<p>TRACKING
<br />Is available for all orders for additional charge
<br />Please be aware, that tracked mail will always require your signature on arrival.
<br />The signature cannot be waived.</p>

<p>REFUND/ RESHIPS</p>

<p>100% reship for all tracked orders
<br />No Tracking – no refund/ reship</p>
