<p>PLEASE NOTE: WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY SUPPLYING STEROIDS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting our profile. Below is a quick guide to the service we provide.</p>

<p>Please be aware that we strive to offer our clients the very best stealth to ensure that your products arrive to you in perfect condition and without intervention from 3rd parties. Therefore we OFTEN remove the product from it's original packaging and re-pack in the most suitable fashion.</p>

<p>____________________________________________</p>

<p>POSTAGE/SHIPPING
<br />____________________________________________</p>

<p>We will normally get your order out for you on the day you place it SO LONG AS you have FEd when required and this is done before 2pm (to allow us to pack and post).</p>

<p>We always endeavor to ship within 48hrs of receiving your order unless it’s the weekend. This applies mainly to our Steroid orders, where we may need to have stock couriered to us overnight to meet demand.</p>

<p>WE DON'T SHIP ON SATURDAY OR SUNDAY. On some rare occasions, this may take a little longer, but you will always be informed if this is the case. As we are proud of our excellent reputation, we are as keen for you to receive your product promptly as you are.</p>

<p>We will send you all necessary details, in encrypted format to ensure you are kept up-to-date with deliveries.</p>

<p>If ordering in bulk, we may have to split your order into smaller parcels. This is for your benefit and does not increase the price to you. We will send the parcels a few days apart and notify you as each one is sent.</p>

<p>____________________________________________</p>

<p>★ For Class A &amp; B Drugs:
<br />We post using Royal Mail 1st Class Post. This is extremely reliable and our packaging is very discreet.
<br />Cost for postage is £1.50. For Bulkier orders this may be slightly higher.
<br />Cut off time for same day dispatch is 2pm Mon-Fri</p>

<p>★ For Steroid and Prescription Pharmaceutical Orders:
<br />We use registered postage on all Domestic orders, unless otherwise stated or requested, so it is VERY IMPORTANT that you are able to sign for your package in the name that it has been sent in. We CANNOT accept responsibility if you provide a false name and then cannot receive your goods because of this. This applies also if International Signed For mail is requested.</p>

<p>If you want to remain completely anonymous, we are happy to send your items to you in ordinary mail. This would require FE.</p>

<p>We cannot however guarantee or confirm delivery and for this reason, prior to postage, we will require you to accept these two facts and accept that we hold no liability in this area.</p>

<p>You must provide us with a note informing us that you wish to use an alternate name and are aware that your parcel will have no tracking and that we are not responsible for ensuring delivery.</p>

<p>If the product is seized by customs we may offer a 25% reship. If you have any trouble with your order please CONTACT US before leaving a rating or review, we will do everything we can to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>By ordering from us you agree to be able to log on daily to finalize after the product has arrived, if this is not possible we will require you to FE on any of your next orders.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Payment Terms.</p>

<p>Because of the highly-volatile nature of BTC and the massive fluctuations in value over short periods of time, we require customers to finalize early on their orders, thus enabling us to lock-in the price and protect ourselves from devaluations. We are also requiring FE do ensure we don't fall victim to escrow losses should the market go down permanently or for a long duration. We’re sure you’ll understand this.</p>

<p>=================================
<br />Please remember to FE your order.
<br />=================================</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: This will make no difference to you as a customer. Your BTC will pass directly to us instead of sitting in Escrow. Your order will be treated in exactly the same manner by us. We will however be able to cash-out at the day's rate, thus receiving the correct FIAT payment.</p>

<p>Any refunds, adjustments to order values or other post-order matters will remain the same. Your buyer rights are not affected.</p>

<p>____________________________________________</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to contact with any questions or if you would require any further information. We'll do everything we can to assist. We are more than happy to supply custom orders and amounts, so again, please feel free to enquire.</p>

<p>____________________________________________</p>

<p>If this site ever goes down please contact us at ITW@safe-mail.net, use PGP for every message please! If you don't we will not respond.</p>
