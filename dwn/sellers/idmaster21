<p>- DISCLAIMER OF USE - </p>

<p>By purchasing &amp; using our IDs, you are aware of the following: </p>

<p>1. We do not advertise the bend test. Some people in fantasy land think that fake ID's can bend to hell with no repercussions. NO fake ID can bend from corner to corner. Do NOT buy our product if you are reliant on the bend test. </p>

<p>2. Cards are encoded to scan &amp; will scan in most modern scanners. However, NO fake is a golden gun &amp; will not scan everywhere due to variances / progression in scanning technologies. Do NOT buy our product if you expect it to scan every single place you go. Be careful. </p>

<p>3. If your card is confiscated while out due to a shitty bouncer / clerk, we are not responsible for your losses. </p>

<p>4. You use these at your own risk! </p>
