<div class='description'>
<p>Hello customers, visitors, patron, and patronizers. I hope I am taking care of everyone as I have been attempting to scale up and streamline my work flow while maintaining the smallest amount of time on Tor as possible. EVERYTHING or as much as possible is done off-line. We Usually check this account once in AM and once in PM. I do not respond to messages, please keep reading to find out how you can contact me.</p>

<p>My new system of order management is working really well. See all it takes is evolving.
<br />Part-Man /
<br />Part open source operating system for the human brain /
<br />Part Machine./
<br />....Once you have plugged into me and my light. I will share with you something that will have you questioning what it is to be a 'Human' I will make you a returning customer. You will love my products. ....</p>

<p>As of this very point in time. All my message have been wiped and my inbox is neat. Please only message me if you really really need to. My Wickr 'webonym' is here, my jabber handle is here, if you read carefully you'll find out how to contact me if your inquire is extremely urgent. Please LEAVE YOUR ORDERS UN-FINALIZED until you have received your gear, and I really enjoy reading feedback after you have tried the product. You DO NOT need to leave FEEDBACK IMMEDIATELY upon finalizing</p>

<p>There is a ton of information in the 400 words that follow. I will be trying to minimize the amount of time spent messaging to maximize the amount of time I am getting your orders together.</p>

<p>Wickr: CosmicConscious</p>

<p>---- Wickr? Wtf? Wickr is an end-to-end (encrypted offline on my device, sent over the wire in that form, then decrypted offline only by your device) encrypted communication application available on Window, Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. It is the bar standard among other similar applications. If you can down load Pandora, or SoundCloud you can download Wickr. Hit me up, and I respond, etc etc and just delete it if when you no longer need it.</p>

<p>It has come to fruition that most of you careless about your own security than everyone else cares about your own security. If You send me your address unencrypted through Wickr or any other method of contact, I MUST FORFEIT my involvement in that order any further. If it was 'processing' it will be declined, if it was marked as shipped, and in the process of being dropped, it will be held back. The very instant where anyone else can read specific identifiable information but myself is the exact time when you should consider yourself luck if it was already dropped We DO NOT LOG... We DO NOT CARE WHERE YOU LIVE. DON'T TELL US. If its encrypted correctly, then only I can read it and math protects that message and consequently the communication that is enclosed.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------</p>

<p>Welcome to one of the most badass store on DNM. Here you will find all different kinds of things that will make you feel all different kinds of ways. I am Cosmic_Consciousness and I will be your host for the time.</p>

<p>Be advised we are not here to chit chat with you, in fact you will I don't talk much, what I have already said in-conjunction with my product, and my reputation speaks for itself... Don't be offended if you don't get a reply from me. In an effort to minimize my time on the tor and maximize my time getting orders ready and other back-end logistics. If you read the profile closely enough you will find exactly how you can contact me. Most users don't get this far, so if you have indeed you must be determined to contact me. Find the clue, put the puzzle togther and you'll find I'm in fact a really easy person to contact. Just not on tor.</p>

<p>I seldom use the market inbox, in an effort to minimize the time spent on tor, in light of recent litigation. Wickr me but leave out anything that would otherwise be encrypted please, swiftly I move forward and I check new orders, and prepare new packages. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. This is done post my twice daily logins.</p>

<p>"The Undisputed King of L.S.D. on Alpha-Bay" - Best feedback ever.!</p>

<p>We take 24-48 hr AFTER being marked shipped to get it into a box. Although it is usually within 24 hrs, we still ask for 48 hrs just in case.</p>

<p>All our items are listed with an estimate 8 working days arrival time. Most land in that time frame. Having said that we don't work well with deadline, nor do we like being rush. What is being done here has never been done at this level before, and with that we strive to maintain and preserve our safety as much as your own while operational. WORKING days does not include Saturday and Sunday, as most people are not 'working' those days.</p>

<p>NEW LISTING ARE TO BE POSTED WITHIN THE NEXT 4 HOURS. YOU WILL LOVE THIS&gt;&gt;!!! Check Back.
<br />Wickr me if I'm not online.
<br />Allow us 10 full business days before contacting us regarding an order that hasn't landed.</p>

<br />fuck yeah...</p>

<p>Have a Question? Read the following...</p>

<p>As promised. We have set-up a harm reduction email.
<br />drintoxication@sigaint.org
<br />This email address will be check by a couple of physicians, who wish to remain anonymous, and myself. Feel free to send any question you may have on combining or concurrent drug usage, or anything related to the use, misuse, abuse, or enjoyment of psychoactive compounds. We do not judge, and we do not ave a stigma against drug usage. We can only advise you on the safety, at the bottom of the barrel it will end up being your own choice. If you would like to know ow a drug works, why it works, how to recover, and anything else related to your health send DrIntoxication an email. My collaborators will likely be checking it more often than myself. Better that way, they are licensed and practicing doctors, who have offered to give up a little bit of their time to addressing question and help users. We will also start to publish question that are good or that we feel would help everyone on a bi-monthly basis.</p>

<p>Please don't ask product questions.I am not the one who will be reading them, I can barely handle a small surge here and sometime have spotty communication. They will be checked by Dr. X and Dr. Y who have no idea regarding the products that are online the prices or any of that other stuff. They know neurobiology, pharmacology, substance abuse treatment, physiology, and all that other stuff. They are 'freshly minted' liberal minded, forward thinking. like minded folk who are USMLE approved physicians. This inbox will be their first time using tor. They are doing this out of a growing concern with various RC's used in combination or in conjunction with classical drugs and causing potentially life threatening cocktails.</p>

<p>~*~*~*~ Health &amp; Harm Reduction: DrIntoxication@sigaint.org ~*~*~*~*~*~</p>

<p>Cosmic_Consciousness will carry, is carrying, or has carried the following products.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />- Multiple varieties of LSD Sourced from Albion. ( Swiss dreaming, Dutch HQ, Indian Rose, China Grey, Asian Xtal, to name a few) Dosages are either 100,150 and 250ug per hit or 110/165/300ug per hit.
<br />- Magic Mushrooms
<br />- 3,4 Methylinedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (Molly)
<br />- Press XTCY pills. (Yellow WB's, Orange Owls, Orange Tesla)
<br />- 2C-B Hcl
<br />- 2C-E pressed pills @ 10mg/per------ NEW
<br />- 2C-I pressed pills @ 10mg/per -------NEW
<br />- 100% all natural organic Opium -----NEW
<br />- N, N - DMT
<br />- Changa herbal smoking blend 50% DMT by weight. f
<br />- L.S.D. Microdots
<br />- 4 AcO-DMT (furmerate)
<br />- High Grade S-iso Ketamine</p>

<p>- Moghandas Chanda: 100% organic all natural Opium mixed with Hashish as done in the villages along the East Indian mountain ranges for centuries. (careful this can be habit forming and I honestly cannot control YOU, YOU must control your own INTAKE. From my research Organic natural opium much like cannabis is seldom the singular cause of death and users will fall asleep (like men in Chinese Opium Dens) before consuming a lethal dose</p>

<p>I flex a link into the global drugs supply chain and all of the products I sourced are from a handful of contacts who are plug directly into the production and have proven time and time again to produce and provide only the BEST QUALITY in THE WORLD. They are all professionals in the industry and have been doing this for decades. We dig deep into the underground black market to sources many of these thing we list. The quality and potency, is in my opinion one-to-one unrivaled in potency that of other vendors, across all the product markets we have a toe in.</p>

<p>We don't source from randoms, and everyone we source from is vetted extensively before they are even considered.. We share this with the masses and our reputation here proves that when it comes to quality we don't fuck around. Regardless if it is the MDMA, the LSD, the Ketamine, the N, N - DMT, the 2C-B, the pressed pills, or whatever you see us offering. We source only the best products available to someone in the network. If you received something that fell short of that statement their is likely something about you. Recent Bezno use, concurrent SSRI treatment, external or internal stimulation of you seretinorgic receptors, or a list of other things.</p>

<p>"The deeper you look into nature the more wonderful you realize it is....
<br />That you are in good keeping there.
<br />You belong to it and you're blessed, you can see and experience it..
<br />Consciousness is the greatest gift to mankind.
<br />Having consciousness...
<br />That man becomes aware of having been created..."</p>

<p>- Albert Hoffman "The Substance: Albert Hoffman's LSD"</p>

<p>I cancel orders as fast as I accept them. Its literally a binary choice for me, and I am impartial to either. One major reason your order gets canceled, is because you use either my main PGP, or one from another market, forum, message board or whatever. I post different subkeys to the same main key, to help me better know how a customers has come to contact me. Old keys, retired keys (to the same main key) will tell me how long I have been working with you, and how you found me. All orders through Alpha-Bay MUST be encrypted CORRECTLY to te PGP key posted ON Alpha-Bay. Specifically to the subkey w/ ID 0x651513C28E0D1B4F</p>

<p>If you encrypt to any other key but the one I have posted here on Alpha-Bay. Your order will not be accepted. Please learn to encrypt , the key is right in front of you. Or check the box where the market does it, and it (the market) will use the key on my profile like normal people would, and do it on your behalf. Double check, in fact triple check that the key 0x651513C28E0D1B4F is in fact the one you are using. Please properly encrypt to the key on my profile and save yourself some trouble. If you have read this far and you are still looking for a way to contact me, for whatever reason, given you have read this far you can get in contact with me on Jabber @ Cosmic_Consciousness@swissjabber.ch. Considering MOST if not ALL the questions you may want to ask are here, and 90% of people don't get this far. If you did, and are awaiting a response to a message and it is not answered here or on the listing, I apologize, and appreciate that you have read this far in an effort to contact me as your inquiry is among a bunch of people who, in all honest are no where near as polite as you have been by reading to this point, and clutter my inbox with questions that are either directly, indirectly, or by the process of inference already address thus far. Contact me on Jabber. Not only will it be me, personally, who is replying or will reply, but given I am behind the computer regularly, you can also be sure that if you drop me a line there, your ahead of the curve, because those who have not read this far would have no idea. Message me.! You can find tutorials on "how to use XMPP messaging" everywhere, and arguably its about as easy as creating an email account. Its a direct line to me, the sole owner and operate of this alias.. Almost like calling on a phone would be. If I'm not there I'll see it when I get there. So leave me something like a "Voice Mail" telling me who you are, and how I can help you. I am blessed to do a lot of good business here, and with that come a lot of customers many of who are just finding out about these corners of the Internet. Like kids in a candy store, it is safe to say they are not well versed in the etiquette.</p>

<p>Here at Cosmic_Consciousness labs we don't believe in just giving LSD out for cheaper than anyone with no regard for the experience itself. We provide a variety sourced from various places and people around the world. When you shop with us, you wont get a lot of shitty LSD for as low of a price as possible, like many other vendors. But you can be sure that from landing to post-consumption your experience is what we want to help induce. We have a wide variety of various dose strengths, forms and mediums to facilitate that consumption. You will never feel like you need to come back for more, because you had a weak experience. Operationally, I strive for nothing but the best and am evolving to set the bar higher than those who have come before me. The pages we dip, and the art we choose to list, in our own way expresses a flair that is artistic, sophisticated, and that the delivery is professional, safe, and for the most part prompt. We much rather sell to consumer rather than street level resellers. The later only being interested in the gains, and the former only looking for a good time. You will find many things we personally enjoy, a couple things we don't prefer to try or have already done too many times :-X , and a few things we really just don't like getting high on.</p>

<p>I flex a link or collection of links who are plugged into the global drug supply chain and over the years have become able to source all the products, at a very high quality we bring it to market. At this junction. Everything we list is something that has been several months in the making. We will test products in a legit lab where real professionals and/or academics collaborate for quality and accuracy and general safety. Many of the people who are involved in this stage of product development do not need or accept monetary compensation for their work, and instead do it out of service to the wider community. They don't get high, probably never have, and possible never will get high on it, they just feel that we (as human beings) have come to a point in our existence where too many lives have been lost to irresponsible dealing, or irresponsible use and that if they can see to it, no more will be lost.</p>

<p>I am honored that when you consume something I sell you, you trust me with your life. Literally. I find this a very intimate bond between us, one that for as long as I am here I will take on, knowing entirely that whatever I am doing is in an effort to hold that bond together.</p>

<p>NO PO BOX orders unless they are formatted like real orders. With a building #, street namee BOX#, etc....
<br />NO ORDERS from NC will be accepted</p>

<p>Messages
<br />Subject Line as follows...... {LISTING ///// DATE} ...nothing more. The simplicity of the subject line is usually what draws us into conversation so a simple one tells us exactly which order you are talking about, Our more streamlined outgoing process has helped us handle issues more appropriately... effective now....
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Do NOT be surprised if you do not receive a response to any of the following.</p>

<p>-Shipping costs are SET correctly. I had to eliminate the 'Add me' for people were abusing it to much.</p>

<p>-If I think you'll receive your order by a certain date. All the info regarding processing and shipping averages are below. Use this information because A) I cannot predict future events and B) I use the exact same info that is posted below.</p>

<p>-For a tracking number OR to see where your order is, especially if it is not late. Tracking is kept for security purposes and is only used to confirm delivery or in case of a dispute. Domestic orders under ~$150 are NOT tracked. International orders are NOT tracked regardless of value</p>

<p>-To message you when your order ships. You can check the status of it anytime on your orders page and Alpha-Bay's order system will notify you of any status change automatically..</p>

<p>-For customized stealth, express shipping, or any other shipping adjustment. Items are prepacked, and shipping is as listed.</p>

<p>-For FREE gear. I pay for this stuff, as do my customers.</p>

<p>-For orders over 60 days old.</p>

<p>-To check your address. Be responsible and triple check your address before ordering. You will get a PM if there are any issues during processing</p>

<p>-To use Paypal, MoneyPac, GreenDot, or any other form of payment other than what is provided by the market. I ONLY transact thorough the Market. It is one of the only eyelets I have open to the world.</p>

<p>-To give you a discount because you don't have enough money</p>

<p>-What the order packaging looks like, or a hint to what it looks like</p>

<p>-How to use PGP or how to get Bitcoin. There are two important resources for both mentioned below.</p>

<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />1.) I highly suggest users switch a couple letters in their sirname to identify the item when it arrives. You will more than likely think the LANDING is empty. ITS NOT EMPTY. JUST GIVE IT AN ENTIRE TACTILE INSPECTION and DONT THROW ANYTHING AWAY!</p>

<p>2.) If you grab an article of mail you have received and inspect it you will notice an 11 black digits code starting with your zip and usually stamped by USPS at the bottom nearly ever article of mail. You will notice the first 5 are your ZIP CODE, the next 4 digits the ZIP EXT, and the final pair of numbers is your mail route. ZIP + EXT + CARRIER ROUT. Yea right there in front of you. You can still insist on leaving it out, but it will delay your mail.</p>

<p>"This is your life, Do what you like and do it often.
<br />If you don't like something, change it.
<br />If you don't like your job, quit.
<br />If you don't have enough time, stop watching TV...
<br />Stop over analyzing. Life is simple.
<br />Open your arms to people. Start to do things. We are united in our differences.
<br />Find a stranger, ask them what their passion is. Share your entire dream with them.
<br />Travel often.
<br />Get lost... It will help you find yourself..
<br />Some opportunities only come once, seize them.
<br />Life is about the people you meet and the things you create with them.
<br />Go out and start creating.
<br />Life is short. Live your dream and wear your passion.
<br />Do what you want. Life is simple. Life is good. Enjoy life
<br />Say "I love you" to somebody everyday...".

<br />Lets do this....
<br />...Good vides &amp; Good love &amp; Light in hand...</p>

<p>QQQQ: Cosmic, Do you ship to MY COUNTRY?
<br />Hell yeah I do. I will just copy-paste whatever you send me onto a label. Done. Not in the US get an international stamp and go away. You could live on the moon and if Mr. Mailman comes around then it a wrap. I don't see why it wont get to you, I can't say how much longer it will take, but I can say I DO NOT CARE WHERE IN THE WORLD YOU ARE.... It doesn't matter. I copy paste the message you send me. I dont ship to North Carolina. And I don't need to explain why. I just don't.</p>

<p>QQQQQ: Cosmic Why is your shipping so random? My first order landed in 3 days and my second one in 11 days?
<br />-Well this is done on purpose. Staying in line with our "Leave no trace and leave no pattern" policy, we often stagger shipments over time, so we can better obfuscate our location and that we are not falling prey to pattern. Don't worry if your order is a little late. Others are on time and other are fast. It is random and you are not targeted for any reason. We feel it is important that when we drop outgoing mail, you are unable to predict when it was dropped. Most mail will arrive within the listed amount of days; 8 days. Some may take a little longer, but we always come through. You can trust us.
