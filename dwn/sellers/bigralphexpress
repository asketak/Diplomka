<p> we are offering 1G free weed to all our customers.
<br /><a href="http://valhallaxmn3fydu.cf/login">http://valhallaxmn3fydu.onion/products/55432</a></p>

<p>We are BigRalphExpress and we sell GHB. We are one of the few GHB vendors to have been operation for over a year and have been on several marketplaces including Evolution, Agora, Abraxas and (currently) Dream.</p>

<p>Our product is very high quality, purity expected to be â‰¥98%. All orders are vacuum sealed and packaged well. We have never had a seal break in transit! Expect your order to be at least one gram overweight. </p>

<p>*****In our recent batch we did have some issues with moisture so some bags may have visible moisture in the bag. All bags are a minimum one gram overweight so the excess should compensate for the added weight of the water, which should be minuscule. </p>

<p>******************************************
<br />It is very important to create a controlled solution when you first get your order. Since GHB is very hygroscopic it will begin to absorb water from the air immediately upon breaking the seal and will make it NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY DOSE THE DRUG DUE TO THE ADDITIONAL WATER WEIGHT. After several days it will be a syrup-puddle. It is important to note here that no GHB is actually lost but it just becomes impossible to measure how much you are consuming and therefore very dangerous. 
<br />******************************************</p>

<p>===__--/ Creating your Solution \--__===</p>

<p>=----------------------------------------------------=
<br />Tools needed:
<br />[glass measuring cup], as pictured here: https://tinyurl.com/qbe8k64
<br />[scissors]
<br />[distilled water] (not necessary but recommended)
<br />=----------------------------------------------------=
<br />*********************************************
<br />1. Cut the seal on the GHB by cutting a small slit from the side of the bag. You don't want to actually cut a huge section away quite yet.
<br />2. ****This step is entirely optional but it will accelerate the whole process.****
<br />Break the GHB into small pieces, the smaller the better. Do this while it is still in the bag! You can use all of sorts of things to do this but be careful not to rip a hole in the bag or damage the surface underneath (the GHB is very,very hard because it is totally dehydrated). 
<br />3. Enlarge that small slit and cut away the whole side.
<br />4. ***Empty the contents of the bag into your measuring cup. I cannot stress this part enough, ADD THE GHB INTO THE CUP WITH NO WATER IN IT. YOU DO NOT ADD THE WATER YET.***</p>

<p>5. (READ THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!!) Determine the amount of water you need to add. The amount of water depends on two things: how much GHB you are dissolving and the ratio you would like.
<br />***We recommend a ratio of 1 gram to every 2 mL.
<br />This works out to 100 mL for a 57 gram order or 200 mL for a 113 gram order, etc.***
<br />I would not recommend going below this ratio because it will take quite some time to dissolve and the final product will be rather syrupy. Try to avoid using ice cold water as it will take forever to dissolve.
<br />5.5. When you determine what ratio you want, ADD THE WATER UP TO THAT LINE ON THE CUP. So to reiterate, if you are diluting 57 grams to a 1-to-2 ratio you would fill the measuring cup up to 100 mL WITH THE GHB ALREADY IN THE CUP. DO NOT ADD THE WATER PRIOR TO ADDING THE GHB. DOING THIS WILL RUIN YOUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DOSE AND RELY ON YOUR MEASUREMENTS AND MAKE THE GHB SEEM FAR WEAKER.</p>

<p>6. Occasionally stir until the GHB is entirely dissolved. This may take a bit, sometimes up to hour depending on the temperature of the water and how fine the chunks are. 
<br />7. Transfer the liquid into a bottle or container with an airtight lid. You must store this in an airtight container otherwise the water will begin to evaporate and once again your ratio will be ruined, actually making the GHB seem far more potent and therefore, more dangerous.
<br />*********************************************</p>

<p>__--/ Dosing \--__
<br />Use the included syringe to dose your GHB out! If you want to take two grams and you made a 1-to-2 ratio solution you would just suck up 4 mL with the syringe and consume it! We recommend adding your dose to a shot glass and diluting it with water. This masks the taste pretty effectively and makes it all around enjoyable. You may check erowid for dosages. Our GHB matches up with erowid's doses if you create your solution properly!</p>

<p>We recommend 2.0-2.25 grams depending on the person (2.5 can work if you have food in your stomach) followed by 1.0-1.5 gram boosters at 2 hour intervals. Some people can handle more but I advise to ALWAYS start low and ALWAYS do a lower booster than your original dose. Tolerance will build very rapidly when combined with stimulants. </p>

<p>***********DEHYDRATED GHB VERSUS LIQUID GHB***********
<br />Our totally dehydrated GHB will be a better product when compared to liquid GHB for two reasons. The primary being that the purity will be much higher. This is because the steps required in the synthesis to completely dehydrate the GHB will force all of the remaining precursor to be used up and any remaining purities are removed via an acetone wash. With liquid GHB you are guaranteed to have at least a moderate amount of the precursor and any other impurities remaining. The other reason is that since you have no idea of the actual purity or potency of the liquid solution you may be getting totally ripped off. There is no way for us to lie to you about the amount that you are receiving from me because it has been dehydrated and I am dealing in actual powder quantities instead of liquids. A vendor selling liquid GHB can say that his mixture contains any amount and you will have no way to confirm that other than to try it. To be honest, the vendor himself probably doesn't even know exactly how much is in the mixture!
<br />****************************************************</p>

<p>***PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS DRUG FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES.***
<br />Obviously we cannot control what you do with our drug but please do not hurt anyone with it. It is a very fun drug when used responsibly. Do not combine with alcohol.</p>
