<p>UPDATE 10/23/15:
<br />HEROIN LISTINGS ARE UP! Only 50 samples size orders (250mg) will be sold, after that the minimum will be 1g. Also, all heroin orders above 1g MUST be accompanied by a separate listing for Express or Priority shipping (signature NOT required, unless requested) so that your order will be tracked to minimize scamming.</p>

<p>UPDATE 10/23/15:
<br />I have gotten tons of requests to add heroin to my listings and after diligently searching for the most perfect, trustworthy source around, I've finally locked down the best available in my area and I do ship Express, so try me out as I'd love to get some lab results and also hear some feedback from experienced veterans on the quality.</p>

<p>Here's a pic of the #4 heroin I have in. Quality is superb and noobs are HIGHLY encouraged to use with caution!
<br />Hi resolution link: http://freedomsct2bsqtn.onion/bhswhxxvltvcxyeilzpj/nhnVyWGe.jpg</p>

<p>UPDATE 10/20/15:
<br />I will finally have heroin listings up this week. Top-notch quality, untouched by me (of course) and ready to ship with the best of stealth, by snail mail, Priority or Express shipping. Check back in a day or two and I'll be ready.</p>

<p>UPDATE 9/9/15:
<br />Apologies if this new policy doesn't work for your needs, however, no more tracking #'s will ever be given out to buyers, only to site admins in the event of a dispute or no show. This is for my safety as well as yours. Thx for understanding.</p>

<p>UPDATE 8/25/15:
<br />I AM AWARE THAT AGORA WILL BE GOING OFFLINE FOR A WHILE AND I WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE ONLY UNDER THE NAME "PUREFORSURE" ON NUCLEUS, ABRAXAS AND OXYGEN FOR NOW, AND POSSIBLY ALPHABAY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I ALSO WILL ALWAYS TAKE ORDERS BY EMAIL AT PUREFORSURE@SIGAINT.ORG OR AS A LAST RESORT PUREFORSURE@CYBERDUDE.COM ONLY WITH ENCRYPTION OR IT GETS DELETED!!</p>

<p>ALL OUTSTANDING ORDERS ON AGORA WILL BE FULFILLED BY ME AND MY SLATE WILL BE CLEAN UPON AGORA'S RETURN. GOOD LUCK TO ALL, MANY THANKS TO THE AGORA ADMINS FOR KEEPING EVERYONE'S SAFETY ABOVE ALL ELSE AND I WISH YOU GUYS ALL THE BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR DNM AFFAIRS UNTIL THE TOP MARKET IS BACK UP AND RUNNING.</p>

<p>CHEERS,
<br />PFS</p>

<p>UPDATE 8/25/15:
<br />Agora's site is screwing up at the moment and I am unable to withdraw coin from my wallet there, so please DO NOT order from me on Agora until further notice. Nucleus and nonamelink are working fine and I will only be taking orders from those sites until further notice.</p>

<p>UPDATE 8/24/15:
<br />I just got a new source because I felt like my normal guy I've been using for years wasn't holding up his end of the quality bargain lately and still charging me the same. I can't lose business, so I lost him instead. Just took me a while to find that superb quality at a decent price from someone trustworthy, but now that that has happened someone should mention to the lab guys to do a random buy and test me again, as this could be even better than the superb product they tested from me before. I did a cocaine cuts test on it, and it did turn a light green, so I'm sure it has some levamisole in it, however, I won't know the exact %age until the lab results are back. The smell, numbing ability, shine and euphoria area all there without the jittery speediness of a lot of the coke out here, so if you want PURE for SURE then you know where to find it!  Here is a pic of the newest batch from my new source (My crack will be cooked from the same cola pictured below):</p>

<p>http://s16.postimg.org/6kgd1tpmc/New_Batch_8_24_15.jpg</p>

<p>UPDATE 8/19/15:
<br />Moving forward PFS will now offer WEEKLY SPECIALS that will change every week and be limited to the first 5 buyers. Some wil be available worldwide and some only for USA customers. Just look through the listings for "WEEKLY SPECIALS" for severely discounted products for the lucky early birds.
<br />Also, I'll be adding Vicodins soon and also heroin and crystal meth, both of very high quality. So STAY TUNED!</p>

<p>UPDATE: 8/8/15:
<br />ROXIES ARE BACK. I now have listings for 30mg Oxycodone Hydrochloride - Crushable Lil Blue ROXIES</p>

<p>UPDATE 6/14/15:
<br />Adderall is now available, but all opiates are still on hiatus.</p>

<p>UPDATE 6/12/15:
<br />Someone hacked my account on Abraxas, changed the pgp key and the listings and the admins aren't doing much to help me get back into my account. I've been writing them for weeks and they respond slowly and don't seem to be offering much assistance. I've asked them to verify my pgp key from Grams and my other vendor accounts, but it may be a lost cause. So DO NOT order from the PUREFORSURE account on Abraxas until further notice, as I will not be able to log in to that account.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/28/15:
<br />Everything is in order and caught up on all orders.
<br />Out of Roxies and Adderall until further notice.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/22/15:</p>

<p>PFS is currently taking orders direct through e-mail at pureforsure@sigaint.org or pureforsure@cyberdude.com. I vend on Agora, Dream, Nucleus, Oxygen and Abraxas, but Kiss seems to be the only working market that I've been able to reliably take orders on in the past day or so. I accepted some orders on Agora late last night when I could barely get on after refreshing each page like 5-10 times, but now I can't get on to mark them shipped, so I'm just hoping this DDOS bullshit ends soon because it's really throwing a monkey wrench in the DNM game at the moment.</p>

<p>If anyone wants quality fishscale or freebase and would like to order from a reputable vendor with integrity and great, stealth and comms who can get your order out quickly now that things are back on track after moving my lab, then by all means shoot me an e-mail and I'll take care of you for sure.</p>

<br />250g=$14,200 (56.8/g)
<br />500g=$26,500 (53/g)
<br />1kg= $50,000 (50/g)</p>

<p>These are direct prices, providing that site fees are bypassed. If order is NON-DOMESTIC USA, add $100 for shipping/handling/stealth and that would be your total. Shipped with tracking, I can guarantee arrival.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/20/15:
<br />Blackbank is still down, but I am all caught up and still taking orders from Agora (now that it's back up and running), Nucleus, Abraxas and Kiss. You can also contact PFS throught direct email at pureforsure@sigaint.org or pureforsure@cyberdude.com to order direct using external wallets. Either way, you will get what you order as fast as I can get it to you and with the best stealth possible. I'm currently considering requiring Express or Priority shipping for all domestic USA orders so that all orders can be tracked. Not 100% certain yet, but I'll update my profile and listings if that turns out to be the case. My account on Blackbank should be reinstated as soon as the site is back online as all the outstanding orders from BB should have arrived by now and their feedback will let the mods know that a few delays from some nervous first-time customers who haven't built up trust in me doesn't mean PFS is a scammer. Back to biz, I'm here if you need me.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/15/15:</p>

<p>Yesterday I shipped every outstanding order on Blackbank (except one and that customer has been informed of the reason) and only have 3 outstanding on Agora (from only a day ago) that will go out today. Every other order on every other site I vend on has been shipped. Every order that took over two days to process had extra product added to it to compensate the receivers for the delay and inconvenience. That's the best I can do for now and I hope that works for everyone who had a late order. If you ordered from me and haven't received it yet, rest assured that your order (with a bonus) has left my hands and is on the way. Please know that despite my vendor account being temporarily suspended for "scamming investigation", I have in no way whatsoever, EVER scammed anyone nor do I ever intend to do so. If you order from me and your order doesn't arrive as quickly as you thought it might, that doesn't mean you got scammed. It means that there has been a delay and you will find out why and be compensated for the delay, but patience is required. Not scamming accusations. I applaud my regular, loyal customers who messaged me (some more multiple times) first before making accusations and leaving negative feedback calling me a scammer. Thanks for the loyalty and for having faith in me. I trust that the past business we have conducted was the main reason you gave me the benefit of the doubt and I just hope you know that now that this difficult time has passed, I am all caught up, back on schedule and ready to get back to business as usual. I'm still vending on all the other sites I have stores on so until BB admins unfreeze my account, feel free to order from me on Agora (if you can actually log on), Nucleus, Abraxus or Kiss, and your order will be shipped with my usual prompt customer service, quality and shipping speed. I can be found under the name "pureforsure" on each of those sites. Once again, my sincerest apologies to anyone who was inconvenienced by my recent difficulties. I've done my best to make it up to those affected by the delay and when I say things are back to normal, my frequent customers know what that means. The best is back! So best wishes to you all and I hope everyone has a great weekend.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
<br />PFS aka PureForSure</p>

<p>P.S. Also, I will be working with hammerit1980 to perfect the levamisole-washing process, so stayed tuned for more on that.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 5/14/15</p>

<p>All is well, apologies on the delay in comms. You know that's not how I operate. I've been going through some serious issues with my operation and have had to relocate my lab for the 2nd time in a month and deal with some major stay-out-of-jail issues. You have no idea! I can't get into details about the problems, but it's just been basically impossible for me to work on processing orders as efficiently as normal without having a permanent place to work from and a secure place to access TOR from while also having to take care of a bunch of odds and ends to get re-situated. And keep in mind that I also have a day job. I'm very careful about how I operate, so I hope you are understanding of my situation here. I'm never a scammer, so rest assured that your order will arrive soon and I will even include some extra to make up for the wait. Once again, apologies on this delay, but things will be okay and running smoothly now. Don't lose faith in me. All is well now. I've been nothing but a stand up vendor for a lot of customers and I only ask that you bear with me getting through this difficult time and everything will be okay. My integrity is never to be questioned. I've never scammed anyone and never would. But I am human, and making a bad judgment call in trusting the wrong person almost cost me more than you'd care to know. Fortunately I was able to straighten it all out with just a scrape or two. Life is good. Back to business! Every outstanding order from me, that hasn't been shipped, will be shipping tomorrow at the latest.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 4/7/15
<br />Hi all, it's PFS, USA cocaine/crack vendor extraordinaire......just wanted to update the community with my current state as the chaos of the last week or two has thrown a lot of shit through the DNM fan. Anyways, I personally got super swamped with orders, e-mails and messages on all the different sites I vend on and after processing about 100 orders in the past 3-4 days alone, I'm finally caught up and at this moment my queue is empty and, despite the delays experienced this past week or so by a few of my customers, I'm back on track and will be shipping orders within a day (48 hours at most) of them being placed and, as always, my quality remains as superb as the best of the DNM's. (Compare mine to any other vendors and you shall see for yourself.) My current batch looks, smells and tastes exactly like what you see in my latest pics from January (below) as I buy from the same source every time and he's very consistent with quality. I plan to start shipping Express and Priority orders internationally (only ship Express/Priority to US customers at present) soon, but only bulk orders of 1oz or more. I've tested out my stealth in doing so on several orders within the past few weeks and all bulk orders shipped internationally with tracking have arrived safely. I'm now vending on Kiss (http://kissmpg5zave56f4.onion) as well and I've opened stores on Crypto (http://cryptomktgxdn2zd.onion) and Abraxas (http://abraxasdegupusel.onion) however, Grams has a warning that Abraxas could potentially be leaking people's clearnet IP addresses, so I won't be logging onto that site until more info becomes available regarding that situation. I'm also investigating Crypto further before I invest any time into developing my store on there. I'm waiting on supplies to come in for further work on perfecting the levamisole-washing procedure as I've now been given more information that should help out in this matter. I truly hope to be able to wash all of my products of this poison sooner rather than later. Much respect to the vendors who've been able to offer levamisole-free products to their customers so far. It says a LOT about your character and I wish you much success and good fortune. Good luck to all the customers out there who have had to migrate to various sites after the Evo theft and I wish the best of luck to you all in your DNM dealings. Hope you have a great week and by all means, feel free to save my email addresses (pureforsure@sigaint.org and pureforsure@cyberdude.com) as if all else fails I will always be taking orders by e-mail as well and I've proven myself time and time again to be a vendor of integrity who will always make good on every transaction that I guarantee per the policies listed on my profiles. HAPPY SHOPPING!!!!</p>

<p>Visit http://postimg.org/gallery/1lxisypde to see hi resolution gallery of my product.</p>

<p>UPDATE 4/2/15: 
<br />It's been hectic but I've been getting the orders processed, just been kinda hard to get on the site and mark them shipped, send confirmation messages AND respond to the inundation of messages on all the sites I vend on, which are ALL running slow as hell btw. Rest assured that anyone who orders from PureForSure will receive their order as fast as I can possibly get it to you, despite all the chaos amidst the DNM community at the moment. I do ask that anyone with outstanding orders please do not message me on BlackBank inquiring about your order. It's just slowing me down even more to have to check and reply to messages on a site that's running slow slow right now. If you MUST inquire about your order, please make it after 48 hours from placing the order and send an e-mail to pureforsure@sigaint.org or pureforsure@cyberdude.com as those email sites are running way faster than any of the DNM's and you'll probably get a much quicker response from me. I also ask that anyone who hasn't received their order as quickly as we anticipated it would arrive, please be patient and know that, despite my workload quadrupling over the past week, I'm busting my ass and losing sleep (seriously 2-3 hours of sleep every day this week!!) to make it all happen for you guys, so I'm just asking that you be understanding and trust me and have faith that I'm a stand up vendor who's trying his best. Thx for all the new business from all the new customers who tried me out this week and also to all my regulars for the continued business. I really appreciate the love, support and loyalty. I also ask that anyone who has had a PFS experience this week amidst the chaos, PLEASE leave a quick review on my thread or any forum to let the DNM community know that I'm a vendor to be trusted who always comes through with the highest quality product. And as soon as the infrastructures of the sites I vend on are updated to accommodate the extra Evo traffic and are running faster, my usual prompt customer service and communication will resume as usual. Have a great weekend everyone!</p>

<p>UPDATE 3/15/15: This Evo fiasco is a shitty deal for all of us. I'm still on point, though, and as hectic as this week has been and is for me right now, I'm trying to keep up with all the orders and messages I'm being inundated with. Rest assured I will be here for all of my customers and invite any new ones to try out a great vendor with integrity and great products. Please save my email address (pureforsure@sigaint.org) in case anything happens with Agora and I'll be reachable through that method has well.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2/6/15: I've removed the Express "postal" listings for INTERNATIONAL EXPRESS MAIL for now. Int'l orders will not have the option of express shipping at this time as declaration papers have to be signed in the post office and I have not worked out how to do this anonymously, so until this is worked out I can only offer express mail to USA customers only. Apologies, but know that I'm working on it. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears. Thx</p>

<p>UPDATE 2/1/15:
<br />I've updated all my listings to reflect my new mailing policy. I now offer express mail shipping on ALL listings, but still offer snail mail on smaller listings. Only snail mail orders will be crushed flat for stealth. All express will be vacuum-sealed with solid chunks of the product exactly as it is when I receive it. I'm offering 1 and 2-3 day shipping in the USA and the equivalent options for international orders. I'm still working on the levamisole issue and will soon post new listings with levamisole-free cocaine and crack. Thanks for all the trust and support from all my loyal customers. I'm doing everything I can to become an even better vendor and offer the best products and services on the DNM's. Just know that I appreciate all the great feedback and support.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1/30/15:
<br />I'm currently working on offering express shipping with tracking on every listing by next week and will be able to offer that from now on with everyone who selects the express mailing option. Also, after testing it has been discovered that, like 80% of all cocaine tested in the US over the past few years, it seems that my product also contains levimasole, probably somewhere around 6%-11%, but further testing is being done to determine the exact amount. Even with the tainted adulterant that is in almost all unwashed coke from the US on the DNM's, my product's quality is still some of the very best that can be found, however at this point I have no source to buy levamisole-free cocaine, so I'm working with an expert or two on the best method of washing levamisole out of my product before selling it and from my understanding I will be one of only a couple of US vendors who will be doing the same thing. Much respect to any vendor who adopts this practice as it makes cocaine shipping on the DNM's a hell of a lot safer for cocaine users. There will be a premium price for the levamisole-free cocaine, but the quality will be well worth the extra coin. I will update my profile, listings and forums threads to keep you all posted on the progress of my cocaine washing protocol. Hopefully I will have this procedure throughly mastered in the next couple of weeks after all my supplies come in. Thanks for all the business and to everyone who has put there trust in me. I won't let you down!
<br />Also my MDMA listings will be back online within the next week.</p>

<p>Visit the CCC (Concerned Cocaine Citizens) website at http://cocaineweogeta6y.onion for more info on cocaine in general and all the latest on levamisole and how to remove it from your cocaine.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1/3/15:
<br />NO ESCROW UNTIL BTC VALUE BECOMES STABLE AGAIN.
<br />I've lost too much from BTC tanking recently and it's dropped so much today that all the Aus orders I've sent with escrow that sometimes take 2-3 weeks to get there have been a loss for me as the profit I would've made has been lost due to BTC value dropping so low. Sorry if this makes anyone uncomfortable shopping with me, but my record is spotless on making sure orders get there after a customer FE's. If you order, I will get it there, but I can't take losses from coin tanking further while coin sits in escrow, so Happy New Year and happy shopping.</p>

<p>The Holiday Sale is over, hope you got a chance to partake of the extra bonuses.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 11-17-14
<br />Out of MDMA until further notice. Out of Morphine until further notice, but I will be listing "20 x Oxycodone Hydrochloride 15mg Crushable Lil Green ROXIES" soon (week or two) so stayed tuned for those.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 11-6-14
<br />I'm aware of the SR incident, and, although it did effect me a little (lost a good bit of coin), all is well and I will continue to do great business on Agora. In light of this situation I am now offering $100 and $250 discounts on my 10g and 28g orders, respectively, until further notice. This is a hectic week for me, though, so there maybe an extra day or two delay on some orders, but rest assured PFS will always come through no matter what. Enjoy your week and be thankful that Agora has such wonderful admins that keep us safe and secure and up and running at all costs and with minimal downtime.</p>

<p>UPDATE: All FE orders of certain listings (indicated on each listing) by returning customers (or new customers with 10 or more successful transactions and positive feedback) will receive an extra 10% of the amount of purchased product as my way of saying thanks for the trust and for doing business with PUREforSURE!!!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm PUREFORSURE</p>

<p>I sell cocaine, crack, and MDMA, but will also be selling heroin, mushrooms and a few other goodies in the very near future.</p>

<p>My cocaine is uncut taken straight from a kilo from South America via Mexico. The quality is unmatched, shiny, fishscale and is perfect for snorting, smoking, injecting or cooking into freebase. My crack will be uncut and cooked from the same product. My MDMA is 84%, very light brown/tan in color and is AMAZING!</p>

<p>When you order from me, unless you purchase a separate listing for Express or Priority mail, your product shall arrive pressed flat (except pills unless requested), vacuum-sealed and in the most stealthy packaging possible with today's technology. I've only had two out of over a thousand packages seized by customs. My packages always arrive and I treat each order with the utmost detail and care to ensure that your purchase from me results in you getting exactly what you paid for and in a timely manner. In the event that you don't, I'll fix it, so please message me with any issues BEFORE leaving negative feedback.</p>

<p>REFUND POLICY:
<br />Update: No reships will be given to Australian customers EVER. Buy at your own risk. Sorry, but I feel I've been getting scammed by buyers whose packages I believe are arriving and I refuse to be taken advantage of. Apologies to the good who have to suffer with the bad.</p>

<p>NOTE: AUS ORDERS ARE NOT GUARANTEED---ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK!</p>

<p>My stealth is remarkable. I get it there. If a DOMESTIC customer (over ten successful transactions) with good feedback orders EXPRESS OR PRIORITY and it gets nabbed (PO letter required and tracking must show that it was NOT delivered), I reship 100%, if it doesn't show again, I initiate the resolving process which could include a partial or full refund. If I can't fulfill the order for whatever reason and the customer has FE'ed then I refund 100%. NO REFUNDS OR RESHIPS WILL BE GIVEN FOR ANY SNAIL MAIL ORDERS IF I HAVE SHIPPED TO THE ADDRESS YOU SUPPLIED. Apologies if this policy doesn't work for you, but I've proven my trustworthiness and will not be scammed again. Either order with tracking or find another vendor who's willing to take more risks.</p>

<p>*********************************
<br />*!!!!!VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!     *
<br />*PLEASE ALWAYS include your     *
<br />*shipping info in the exact     *
<br />*format as shown below AND      *
<br />*********IN ALL CAPS*************
<br />*        as follows:            *

<p>FIRSTNAME LASTNAME
<br />12345 N. STREET BLVD
<br />CITY, STATE 12345
<br />COUNTRY (if outside USA)</p>

<p>Any questions, please feel free to message me on this site, but don't message me asking exactly what day your order will ship as I don't give out that info for obvious reasons and if it hasn't been longer than 7 days for domestic USA orders or 14 days for non-domestic USA orders then please don't message me asking where your package is because it's out of my hands and I don't work for or control any aspect of the USPS.
<br />SHIPPING TIMES DOE NOT INCLUDE PROCESSING TIME!!!!! I give myself a max 48-hr window to process an order, so please DO NOT message me before then inquiring about your order as 100 inquires a day slows me down substantially!</p>

<p>In the event (AND ONLY IN THE EVENT) that the market is offline for any reason, I may be reached by e-mail at pureforsure@sigaint.org</p>

<p>Thanks for your business,
<br />PUREFORSURE</p>
