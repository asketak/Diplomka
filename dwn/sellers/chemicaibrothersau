<p>Hello guys and girls!</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />UPDATES!
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Hi all on Valhalla!</p>

<p>26.09.2016 - Hi all! Out of ice/meth at the moment. Resupplied but I did not
<br />like the quality and did not want to supply poor quality in the place of great product I had before so I have taken it off my shelves until I get new supply. I hope it will be in within 24-48 hours. Will update and put up the listings with new stock once it is available.</p>

<p>26.05.2016 - NEW MDMA in :) Tan brown MDMA crystals imported from Amsterdam! Already seen and tested and its the amazing quality you have come to love from my MDMA listings. All listings are up with new photo coming soon :)</p>

<p>11.01.2016 - Firstly I want to apologize to all my customers over Nov-Dec 2015. I was completely unprepared for the absolute boom in orders that I received on the DNMs since Agora disappeared and Abraxas went exit scam and so as a result I couldnt keep up with all my messages at all. I have always found pride in the way that I ran my shop over the years however the rush that happened since roughly the beginning of November caught me COMPLETELY unprepared and coupled with issues with the post from 16th November to the other side of the country and postal delays as a result PLUS the biggest weeks ever due to stereosonic around the country PLUS heap of public holidays over Christmas and New Years led a lot of problems which I aim to have now fixed.</p>

<p>I was packing orders for 18 hours every day over most of November and December and it ended up backfiring for me so moving forward with my entrance to Valhalla there will be changes.</p>

<p>1. For starters, I will not be accepting big orders from people I haven't dealt with before. Anything over 7g is a 'big' order. If you are new and want to place a big order. Contact me first or else your order will be rejected.
<br />2. I have already started this but just so you all know I will be packing all orders with two people checking weight is perfect - so to all potential quantity scammers (those of you who claim half deliveries and try to tell me the amount of baggies inside your packages) find someone else to target because your tactics wont work.
<br />3. If tracking shows delivery to your suburb or to a suburb immediately closeby to you then its been delivered according to my policy. I will judge each claim of nondelivery on its own merits and will involve support straight away.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT! If you have recently moved to a new area, or if you are not sure if express post will be delivered quickly, send yourself an express post envelope from a few suburbs further away from you and see if it arrives. This should also help you see how many days it will take for your order to arrive.</p>

<p>ALSO - TO SAVE ME HOURS EVERYDAY AND TO MAKE SURE YOUR ORDER IS NOT DELAYED, PLEASE SET OUT YOUR ADDRESSES PROPERLY WHEN YOU SUBMIT IT TO ME WITH YOUR ORDER.</p>

<p>FOR EXAMPLE</p>

<p>NORMAL ADDRESS:</p>

<p>ADAM SMITH
<br />10 One Street
<br />SUBURB STATE POSTCODE</p>

<p>OR IF ITS A UNIT:</p>

<p>ADAM SMITH
<br />Unit 1 / 10 One Street
<br />SUBURB STATE POSTCODE</p>

<p>OR IF ITS A COMPANY/BUSINESS THAT YOU DO NOT OWN:</p>

<p>ADAM SMITH
<br />NAME OF COMPANY PTY LTD
<br />FLOOR NUMBER / STREET NUMBER / STREET NAME / STREET TYPE (Rd, St, Ave)
<br />SUBURB STATE POSTCODE</p>

<p>Message me at anytime guys and girls. I am happy to answer any and all questions you may have.</p>

<p>I hope all of the above explains in some way my recent negative feedback and I hope you choose my shop moving forward :)</p>

<p>cheers
<br />-CB</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>NO ESCROW IS OFFERED IN MY SHOP SORRY BUT NO EXCEPTIONS :)</p>

<p>HOW TO ORDER:</p>

<p>Step by step to order:</p>

<p>NO ESCROW OFFERED SO PLEASE WHEN YOU ORDER, PLEASE RELEASE ESCROW IMMEDIATELY TO SAVE ANY DELAYS.</p>

<p>Place your orders by 12:00pm and release payment, ill print off your address and click ship soon after. I'll THEN send your order within 24 hours. Sometimes quicker. If within 4 days you don't receive your package, request your tracking off me and ill gladly give it to you :)</p>

<p>I already have many sales through many darknet markets as you can see :)</p>

<p>Im on the level. Im not here to scam anyone. I just want to be paid and to pay those who I NEED to pay and I cant be affected by bitcoin fluctuations or sites going down ongoingly. Not acceptable to delay payments in my world so Im sorry but if you want to deal with me thats the condition (no escrow). I have never asked this before but these have been very turbulent times, the sheep marketplace scam cost me big, BMR going down has also affected my ability to trade, SR 2.0 as well and with late finalisations in payment, I have been losing out due to the bitcoin fluctuations and these darknet sites going down.</p>

<p>Have been on the darknet for a long time people :) I have established myself as a trusted vendor on the darknet and my feedback speaks for itself as to how far I would go for my customers but in turn, I expect that payment be finalised early just so I can continue paying my cook on time and wont be affected by late payments or bitcoin fluctuations or sites being down for a while.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>A LITTLE BACKGROUND :)</p>

<p>I am an ex Aussie SR v1.0 and SR v2.0 Vendor and BMR refugee by the same name! (My PGP is the same). Was also on SMP and got royally scammed. When SR v1.0 went down, I was voted in the top 15% of sellers, with no negative feedback at all. I was also the number 1 speed seller on SR when SR went down, and the top seller of speed in Australia on Sheep Marketplace... lost alot in that scam.. I was also the number one speed seller on SR when SR went down and the top Aussie seller of purely speed only on BMR.</p>

<p>Please check my feedback on other markets :) - always check that my PGP aligns with those on other market places.</p>

<p>I was and STILL AM providing the Aussie community with quality chunky chipped off speed straight from the ounce rock (NO CUTTER/FILLER ADDED) and to my customers doorstep within (in most cases) 24-48 hours.</p>

<p>You will receive mostly chunky pseudo based speed rocks with minimal powder with your orders of my speed. From time to time, I also stock imported high grade MDMA, Cocaine and highly sought branded Valiums.</p>

<p>MESSAGING ME</p>

<p>I am introducing a new system to help me answer the most urgent messages first. Please use one of the following in your subject title when contacting me:</p>

<p>1. EXISTING ORDER - Please use this in your subject line to me so I can quickly get back to you with further info. Chasing up existing orders and being in contact with customers waiting for their product is my number one priority. I only ask that you please look at my accounts page for regular updates (so I dont have to waste time answering questions that I already addressed) and if my global announcements do not answer your questions then please contact me with your questions/issues.</p>

<p>2. CUSTOM ORDER - Please use this when you are inquiring about custom sized lot orders.</p>

<p>3. GENERAL QUESTION - Use this when you want to enquire about current batches, dosages or any other miscellaneous questions.</p>

<p>In regards to all my messages I aim to answer them within 24 hours. Existing orders I will answer ASAP. Please understand I get hit with as many as 40+ messages a day now on average so this new way of messaging me will ensure I get onto the most time critical messages first.</p>

<p>PACKAGING</p>

<p>I pride myself on my quick turnaround and stealth of my packaging. I vacuum and myler seal every order under the strictest anti cross contamination conditions and my operation complies (if tested by a government lab) with high grade sterilization techniques that would conform to the ISO 11737 series.</p>

<p>All my orders are for DOMESTIC AUSTRALIA ONLY and I VAC/MYLER SEAL ALL MY ORDERS! Nothing comes from overseas. This is strictly an Australian domestic operation.</p>

<p>PAYMENT</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, I lost alot of money from customers who just didnt finalise on time. For me to keep paying for more wonderful products for you all to enjoy, I need you to finalise payment asap.</p>

<p>SHIPMENT</p>

<p>All my products are shipped domestically by express post around Australia only and are vac/myler sealed prior to sending. You will NOT need to sign for your package. If you live on the other side of the country to me or if you live outside the express post zone, you will most likely receive your package 2 days after ordering. I try to get all my orders for the day sent out by the 6pm cutoff, so please if you expect to receive your product quickly please ensure you order earlier on in the day or the night before just to be safe.</p>

<p>IF this site ever goes down, immediately speaking you can contact me by email cb@anonymousspeech.com.</p>

<p>cheers!
<br />-CB</p>
