<p>-----Shipping-----</p>

<p>European orders: 3-5 business days
<br />Danish orders: 1-3 Business days
<br />Rest of the world: Please write us before ordering, as special conditions may apply.</p>

<p>We take your security as seriously as our own, therefore all mushrooms are vacuum packed and sealed in a double layer of moisture barrier bags to ensure that no smell escapes.
<br />The packets are disguised using a well thought-out stealth technique, to make them look ordinary and completely harmless. Packets are constructed in such a way that any attempt at opening or tampering will leave obvious signs on the package.
<br />All packages will fit in a regular mailbox, and nothing sent out by us will ever require a signature.
<br />All Packets will be shipped with the national postal service, and no tracking numbers will be supplied to the customer.</p>

<p>-----Address-----</p>

<p>We will only use printed labels, and the address supplied must be in the correct format for your country. We do not have time to research address formats and correct every address individually, therefore the address will be printed exactly as we receive it.
<br />Please note that your address must include a name, as a nameless address can make the package seem suspicious. Please make sure the name looks legit, i.e. no soccer players or celebrities. We will not be sending out stuff addressed to the likes of Marco Van Basten, Michael Laudrup or George Best.
<br />An address must be supplied with every order, even for return customers. As a security precaution all addresses and related information is deleted/destroyed as soon as the label has been printed.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not send your address in cleartext, always use PGP</p>

<p>-----Escrow/FE-----</p>

<p>We will never ask for FE on our regular listings, but larger custom orders may require it.
<br />You are required to finalize the order immediately upon receipt. If an order is left to auto-finalize, i.e. making us wait 14+ days before the funds are released, you will be blacklisted and as such we will no longer be accepting any orders from you.</p>

<p>-----Encryption-----</p>

<p>Please make sure that all communication with us is encrypted using PGP. It is not difficult to learn, and it's a fundamental part of your opsec. </p>
