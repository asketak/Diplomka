<p>***DREAM MARKET (27) 100% POSITIVE FEED BACK***</p>

<p>'5/5 NDD was weary of the powdered form but could tell and taste it was magic mushrooms also it was over weight it was crushed/grinded precisely the shrooms where dried correct. the trip and healing was incredible some potent shrooms I suffer from Chronic fatigue and mercury poisoning and I did pretty well on these also a friends depression is alot better nearly gone thanks friend. Will be purchasing more soon was handy not having to eat the actually shrooms as I always get nasuea/sickness'</p>

<p>'Beautiful mushrooms: 1g (taken with 300mg caapi alkaloids) was a deep 6 hour journey, not visionary at that dosage but profound and healing. Felt very clean, and the mushrooms themselves were surprisingly delicious. NDD too'</p>

<br />(Source:erowid.org)</p>

<p>IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ALWAYS START ON A LOW DOSE AND WAIT AN HOUR TO CHECK YOUR CURRENT TOLERANCE AND THE MUSHROOMS STRENGTH. BEING A PLANT MEANS THE ACTIVE COMPONENT CAN DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM MUSHROOM TO MUSHROOM.</p>

<p>Our mushrooms are grown with great attention, respect and care. Only the highest quality supplies are used. The mycelium is slowly cultivated on Certified Organic Rye Grain, we even use mineral water
<br />instead of tap water to maintain the highest of quality standards.
<br />Throughout the entire process hygiene is maintained to that of food preparation and environmentally friendly cleaning products are used.
<br />At every stage equipment is either sterilized for future use or properly recycled.
<br />We have an independent solar supply set up solely for the mushroom cultivation.
<br />We deeply believe that magic mushrooms are not simply a drug to get high from but a uniquely special and trans-formative tool for the mind.
<br />Therapeutic and medicinal practice with these sacred plants can be instrumental in fundamental improvements to individual and social perspectives.
<br />It is for these reasons we firmly believe ethical production methods are essential to the quality of the plant and the feel good of the psychedelic adventurer.</p>

<p>Please note that Psilocybin is equally spread across the mushrooms so the cap and stem are the same strength. The majority of your mushrooms will be whole, however the caps and stems can be separated in transport.</p>

<p>High quality gloves are used for packaging.</p>

<p>We never use bare hands for the handling of any of our products to ensure the highest quality and of course for our own security.</p>

<p>Delivery is undertaken with great care and attention and the packing process ensures our mushrooms should reach you in a high state of quality.</p>

<p>Historically, Central and South American Indians have considered hallucinogenic mushrooms, called "god's flesh," to be sacred. Mushrooms have been used in social and religious rituals to produce visions to aid in treating illnesses, solving problems, and contacting the spirit world.</p>
