<p>=============NOTICE==============
<br />NEW CUSTOMERS PLEASE READ THE PROFILE IN ITS ENTIRETY, THANK YOU :)
<br />=================================
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<br />In loving memory of Complex. We will never forget you. 
<br />=================================
<br />========LATEST NEWS BELOW========
<br />Don't believe us?
<br />http://grams72tru2gdpl2.onion/infodesk/vendor/0xE2BC4B44E04A0ABA
<br />========================================================
<br />3/13/16:
<br />BIG changes are coming. Be ready to read and agree to an entire new set of fair rules and conditions. It's for the greater good.</p>

<p>I am Infinite, I have never done you wrong. I never will.</p>

<p>And no, we are not discontinuing our Alp :)
<br />Infinite
<br />================================================================
<br />3/11/16:
<br />Adderall postings are back up! They go FAST so we do not hold them for you to cash you paycheck. We make exceptions for good repeat customers, but these are first-come-first-serve. Sorry, but if you want them to keep flowing, we need that money and we're not waiting until your payday just to place the order :)</p>

<p>We got a pretty decent amount this time, obviously I cannot disclose how much, but anyone waiting should be able to be served. </p>

<p>We resume shipping ALL orders tomorrow!</p>

<p>Honesty is the best policy,
<br />Infinite
<br />===============================================================
<br />2/24/2016:
<br />It has come to our attention that many orders, especially those placed around Valentine's day, are still late. Some of these orders are around 2 weeks late before finally being delivered. If you're familiar with InfiniteCom, you know this happens every Xmas/New Years/Vday, and if you need to extend FE, please do. </p>

<p>Please note that we simply cannot give you a time on the delivery. The USPS does not provide us with that information. </p>

<p>If you're wondering (where the hell is my package?!).. It's probably with the rest of the backed mail. </p>

<p>We thank you very much for your patience, you have all been understanding. We hope to see you receive soon!</p>

<p>Infinite
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />2/23/2016:
<br />Our newest batch of alprazolam is here! All the orders have been upped, and we are ready to meet any and all demands you may have! Happy shopping!</p>

<p>Infinite</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>2/13/16
<br />After a hugely successful reopening to the stores, it looks like I have a full time job again. To show our appreciation to those who have stuck behind us, stood up for us, and have been waiting our return, we will be adding 10% extra of each order to the bag, with a maximum of 10 grams. Upon the next restock, weill be bringing back the 10% additional product promition. If it sticks and people like it, it will remain perminant to show our appreciation for you guys. Its easilly one of the best places to get ALP on here at all, so consider it a win-win!</p>

<p>Infinite uses drugs.
<br />Infinite is responsble.
<br />Be like Infinite</p>

<p>As always, feel free to ask me anything, and let us know know if you have any issues. </p>

<p>Sincerely,
<br />Infinite
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />2/7/2016:
<br />After roughly two months of re-structuring within our own ranks, InfiniteCom is 100% open for business. I apologize to anyone who might have been let down by seeing our listings up, but this is something DM does in order to keep this account alive, and we surely do not want to lose it you know?</p>

<p>All orders will be sent on a first come first serve basis, even if that means your order is accepted right away. It might not get shipped for a day or two, but we will handle it. </p>

<p>!!   PLEASE READ THE FOLLOW! THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE FOR SOME OF OUR LISTINGS   !!</p>

<p>ALL LARGE TICKET ITEMS MAY REQUIRE YOU TO FINALIZE EARLY. THIS ESPECIALLY APPLIES TO FIRST TIME BUYERS. WE DONT APPRECIATE DISPUTES OR THREATS OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK BECAUSE YOU ARE IMPATIENT. YOU WILL WAIT TWO WEEKS MAX BEFORE FILING A DISPUTE ON SAID ITEMS BECAUSE OUR BIGGEST ENEMY IS THE POSTAL SERVICE. ALL ITEMS ARE SENT THE DAY THEY ARE MARKED SHIPPED. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE US, CHECK OUR GRAMS PAGE. WE -ALWAYS- DELIVER!
<br />===========================================================
<br />1/10/16: ADDERALL 30MG IR ARE BACK IN STOCK! 20MG TO BE ADDED SOON!</p>

<p>=================================
<br />1/7/2016:
<br />IF YOU RECEIVED A FREE SAMPLE FROM US PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK!  We're trying to build a name for ourselves, we literally gave out dozens of samples across markets and got under 5 feedbacks.
<br />=================================
<br />Now that all orders are cleared from escrow. all alprazolam listings will go back up.
<br />All of our orders are sent aside from the two customers who were already notified that their order will be 1 day (if at all) shipped after I mark it shipped. I don't like the whole auto-fe thing, and I don't like if people think I'm dicking them around while the auto FE ticks down.  Any orders placed between Thursday and Sunday will be dropped off on Monday. If you need something shipped, you should take that into consideration! Just a heads up for my loyal fans.</p>

<p>Ketamine and tapentadol will be arriving as stock in the very near future. If you have requests, feel free to ask.</p>

<p>I[ll say it one more time:
<br />If you ever have questions regarding your order, please contact us and it very wel could have been an oversight. If you go leave me a bad review without talking to us first, which you agree to in your terms of sale but chose to violate, we will NOT REFUND YOU A SINGLE PENNY IF YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE. </p>

<p>We will also be putting up the adderall listings again, and this time we have access to more so hopefully we don't sell out immediately. </p>

<p>Oxy 30s and Ketamine isomer will also be added to our lists.</p>

<p>Infinite</p>

<p>================================</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to InfiniteCom! </p>

<p>For those who are not familiar with us, we specialize in Alprazolam API. Pure, pure stuff. We had about 145 total sales in our 6 week period, and a 100% positive feedback rating. On Abraxas we were at about 50, just starting, so hopefully that shit is over with. Of course, this is all gone now, so we will establish ourselves all over again here.</p>

<p>My name is Infinite. I represent InfiniteCom in terms of processing orders, and dealing with any questions you guys have about your orders, or just shootin' the shit in general. Never feel like you're bothering me by sending a message our way, it's why I'm here. I am our PR dude, as well as our customer support rep, so anytime you correspond with us, you will be speaking to me personally. We feel this is the best way to build a personal relationship with our customers.</p>

<p>Please note that our prices are only temporary. They will be adjusted in time, since we're trying to get back on our feet again in light of recent events. </p>

<p>We have giant plans for expansion and the addition of new products in the near future, so be sure to check back!</p>

<p>Infinite
<br />==========================
<br />Ok, so let's get to it.	</p>

<p>OFFICIAL TERMS OF SALE:
<br />--------------------------
<br />STOP! WARNING! READ! !!!
<br />STOP! WARNING! READ! !!!
<br />--------------------------
<br />By ordering from InfiniteCom, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to all terms of sale and our refund policy. If you do not agree with these terms, do not order from us. In time, our feedback will speak for us if you have your doubts. 
<br />==================</p>

<p>========INTRODUCTION======= </p>

<p>We specialize only in the purest domestic alprazolam API you can get. We don't sell any other products at the moment, as we simply don't need to. We take pride in our product, and feel no need to expand for the moment.
<br />We were highly successful on evo and AG, and we plan on being just as successful, if not more, on Alpha. </p>

<p>We will be offering bulk discounts, just ask and be smart about it. Use encryption. If you have any requests, just let me know, and we'll look into it for you. </p>

<p>=======POLICIES======</p>

<p>1. All listings are offered in both escrow, and FE. The choice is yours, however, escrow listings will cost more due to the risk of having money being held, and the instability of the markets. However, we give you a choice in this matter, and if you wish to FE, you will receive a discounted price. Because we are new to this market, FE options are currently not being offered.</p>

<p>2. No samples. We have proven ourselves and our product on evo, and if you want verification of the quality of our product, all you need to know is that we sell -exactly- what we advertise, including the brand.</p>

<p>3. Custom orders or bulk orders must be submitted to us via PGP messaging only.</p>

<p>4. We do not split orders. If you wish to place different orders to the same address, I will combine them into a single package.</p>

<p>5. We do not sell Alpraz pills at the moment, and we don't offer advice on pressing. We have no information about doing this, so asking would be a waste of time. We never have, and do not plan on EVER pressing, sorry.</p>

<p>6. No tracking numbers will be given to customers under any circumstances. They will only be shared with a staff member in the event of a dispute. These are used only for verifying a dispute claiming to have not received our product, and to verify that your order was or was not received during the 30 days grace period before refunds are issued.</p>

<p>7. Do not send any addresses or requests for custom orders without PGPing the information. These orders will be declined, as we care about the safety of our clients, and we encourage that you learn to protect yourselves as best you can when dealing on the dark net. No exceptions about this, sorry.</p>

<p>8. We mark packages shipped when they are literally dropped off. We do not mark them at the end of the day, or before they go out. The shipping we mark is essentially real-time. If your package is marked as confirmed, it means we have received your order, and it will be dealt with in the order it is received, and if we should have any questions, we will contact you. We mark them confirmed as we receive them, so that we can make sure customers are handled in proper order.</p>

<p>9. Personalized customer service is included in the price of every purchase. My evo customers know we go above and beyond when it comes to keeping our customers informed of any anticipated dalays, answering any questions you may have, or just shootin' the shit with you if you wish. We answer all messages as soon as we receive them (unless I'm asleep or something), and we always answer your messages within 24 hours. I usually answer them instantly. </p>

<p>=====SHIPPING=====</p>

<p>This is why our refund policy is so forgiving. If you order from us, you WILL receive. We ship all orders the day after they are placed, first thing in the morning. The cutoff is 9PM PST. We ship Monday through Friday, and all orders placed Friday through Sunday will be shipped on Monday. We do not ship weekends, and we do not ship NDD or express. We ship priority, but we DO NOT GUARANTEE LIGHTNING FAST DELIVERY! Most of the time it's fast, but some times things get slowed down, and it isn't anything we can do to speed the order up. Please be patient, and allow at least 5 business days before contacting us about a late order.</p>

<p>Please understand that while most packages land within 2 to 4 days average, there have been times where the USPS has dropped the ball on us and deliveries were late enough that we pre-maturely issued refunds, and then the packages were delivered, and we lost both product and payment. This is the only reason we use a 30 day grace period. </p>

<p>Your package will be made to blend in with your every day mail. Without going into details, it is well protected, well secured, draws no unwanted attention in any way.</p>

<p>We charge a fee of $12.99 postage to cover the cost of the postage, and shipping overhead costs. These things can quickly start to add up, so we charge a few bucks more for postage than the stamp itself, rather than increasing the prices of our products.</p>

<p>======REFUNDS======
<br />1) Due to several late packages in our history (mostly due to weather and the air of air mail), we are implementing a 30 day grace period before we issue ANY refunds regarding your order. This period starts the moment we hit the "Shipped" button and your order is en route. We make NO exceptions to this rule. Because of this, we will offer a 100% refund to ANY package which is deemed "Not delivered" via the tracking number for the order after this time frame has passed. In the event the value of your coins decreases after these 30 days pass and you never received, we will COMPENSATE you the difference in coin, so you don't lose a cent with us. We are THAT confident in our successful deliveries. Once the 30 days is up, and you have not received, we will issue you a 100% refund, NO QUESTIONS ASKED at this point! Due to our 100% successful delivery rate, we feel this is a very reasonable policy.</p>

<p>2) In the event that orders are marked as a "confirmed delivery", you will not be entitled to a refund of ANY KIND, as we are not responsible for false information provided by the customer in terms of address or name, and if our tracker says your package was successfully delivered, we feel we have honored our end of the deal. For this reason, please use valid information. Any packages marked "Undeliverable" will also not be considered for a refund, since we literally just copy and paste the information you provide as an address.</p>

<p>Encryption is required, or we will decline the order. Please format your address as follows when encrypting it. :</p>

<p>First Last
<br />99 Agora Street
<br />Apt. #
<br />City, State abbreviation Zipcode</p>

<p>Because we only ship domestically, there is no reason to add United States to the final address line. This actually draws a degree of suspicion, so we will remove this line automatically, as it is unncessary for domestic orders. This is the only time we will alter an address that is submitted to us. Please double check to make sure you enter the correct information, you wouldn't want to accidentally have it sent to a neighbor.</p>

<p>3) If your package is late, please contact us and let us know. We stand by our 30 day grace period no matter what, but we will want to know if packages start arriving late for OPSEC reasons. In the event your package is so late that it will AF, we ask that the order be disputed after contacting us, and we'll wait out the grace period. After your package either arrives, or does not, we will refer to the stated refud policy.
<br />This happens to roughly 2% of our orders, so it's not something we deal with often. We're just covering our asses due to past losses. We apologize if the USPS drops the ball on a timely delivery, but some things are simply out of our control. </p>

<p>4) Did you FE and your package is late? Don't worry, since we honor all agreements, even FE'd orders will receive 100% of the credit they spent.  We will make sure these orders land via tracking, and if they don't, you will be refunded the exact dollar amount you FE'd to us. Not the coin amount. You will get back exactly the amount you spent, no matter what. Whether this be an FE order, or an Escrow order. In both cases, the 30 day grace period applies. By FEing you agree to the same policy as orders in escrow, and after 30 days of the order being finalized in FE situations, a total refund will be issued if not received. All packages are tracked and recorded until the order is finalized. After that, the tracking is destroyed. </p>

<p>5) Rudeness and demands do not go far with us. I am a very easy person to talk to, and you will always be dealing with me, Infinite, when it comes to customer service. We treat all customers with respect and professionally, and all we ask is for the same respect, and understanding.</p>

<p>If you push us, we will push back. Respect goes both ways, and I'm done dealing with assholes. Your money isn't worth the headache, so let's all keep it professional, and all problems will be solved.</p>

<p>By placing any order, you agree to ALL terms of sale. If you message us complaining you didn't receive your order immediately, we will ignore it. You will get your order, or you will get 100% refunded, just don't harass us or be nasty about it. Demands will get you NOWHERE.</p>

<p>====FEEDBACK=====</p>

<p>Please don't leave any feedback until product arrives, and has been tested. And please only leave fair reviews. We do not take bribes for good feedback, and the staff will be alerted of your intentions if you attempt to bribe us. We will not accept any offers from people asking for freebies in exchange for good feedback.</p>

<p>By ordering from us you agree to speak to us directly before leaving negative feedback so we can find out what the issue is, and correct it. If negative feedback is left unjustly, we will fight it, and you will be blacklisted. </p>

<p>Thank you for shopping with us, and we look forward to doing business with 
<br />you! +1 for you for reading the entire terms of sale :)</p>

<p>Infinite,
<br />The voice of InfiniteCom</p>
