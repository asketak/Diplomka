<p>We are "Chapomart". We have been supplying the darknet with the highest quality BTH/Huff/Gunpowder available anywhere for the past several months. We have made a name for ourselves through providing AlphaBay with what is TRULY the highest purity BTH available anywhere, on or off the darknet, and now we are proud to announce we are expanding to other markets. Chapomart's presence on the darknet started about 5 months ago on Alphabay and very quickly we developed a reputation for providing the highest quality BTH on the darkweb, and the highest quality heroin of any kind that many of our customers had ever seen. I have acquired my product from the same source for almost 2 decades, and by the time it reaches my hands I am the first non family member to touch it. From manufacture all the way to my hands and then to yours, this product is 100% unaltered, exactly as it was the day it left the lab. </p>

<p>Since we opened up shop we have been consistently hearing EVERY DAY that our product is hands down the best heroin people have ever seen, on the darknet or the street. This is heroin for the opiate connoisseur. Everyone who has tried our product has been completely blown away by the product and we guarantee you will too. Our reputation is what makes our business, and we would bet our reputation on it without hesitation. </p>

<p>We look forward to you trying for yourself what the darknet has been raving about.</p>

<p>Our product's quality is consistent. It's ALWAYS huff/gunpowder and we do everything we can to keep it in that form all the way to your hands. Smaller orders (0.2-0.5s especially) tend to get more exposure to the humidity in the air, which even in small doses can turn a thin powder into a solid. This does not affect the quality WHATSOEVER and either way it is the exact same dope. Larger orders (3g or more) will ALWAYS make it to your hands in its raw "gunpowder" form as will most orders of at least 1g, but 0.2s-0.5s sometimes get more exposure to air and may not always look like our pictures. ONCE AGAIN IT IS THE SAME PRODUCT REGARDLESS AND THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE QUALITY WHATSOEVER. </p>

<p>Before we decided to open ChapoMart we spent time all over the country, often times in places with no dope scene, and during that time I sampled BTH from EVERY major vendors on Alphabay and Dream Market. No matter how much we searched we couldn't find anything that was up to par with what we were used to getting at home... Even on the street in major heroin states like New York and New Jersey we still could rarely find anything that could stand up against what we had been getting at home for years, and if we could it was on VERY rare occasion when #4 with a 90%+ purity level would come around, and since the Fentanyl boom a product like that has only grown in rarity. </p>

<p>And so out of that grew ChapoMart. A business striving to provide the darknet with products that live up to OUR standards. And the difference between us and most other vendors out there saying the same thing is the fact our product will back up EVERY WORD WE SAY. BTH that is truly pure does not come in different varieties that are "better for smoking" or "better for IV" as many vendors claim; BTH at its purest is perfect for IV or smoking, and our product is exactly that. It leaves totally clear trails on foil with no taste of sugar or any other cuts, and gives a very strong clean rush that lasts forever when IV'd. It really does not get any better than this if you're dealing with BTH, whether its "gunpowder" or any other form. </p>

<p>PLEASE EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN TESTING OUR PRODUCT REGARDLESS OF TOLERANCE. START SMALL, REMEMBER YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE!!</p>

<p>-Please allow 24-48 hours to process shipment. This is almost never the case, as we try to ship as many orders as we can on the same day if possible, which is 90% of the time, but in rare occasions when we are swamped sometimes it can take a bit more time to process.</p>

<p>-We do not give out tracking numbers under any circumstances. We will track your package for you if the expected delivery time is exceeded (5 days for priority, 2 days for express). </p>

<p>-Please do not message us asking where your package is until after expected delivery time is exceeded. </p>

<p>-IF YOUR SHIPPING INFORMATION IS NOT ENCRYPTED YOUR ORDER WILL BE CANCELLED. PLEASE ENCRYPT ALL AND ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION</p>

<p>***IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR ORDER PLEASE SEND US A MESSAGE BEFORE POSTING BAD FEEDBACK SO WE CAN TRY TO CORRECT THE SITUATION. IF YOU POST BAD FEEDBACK BEFORE REACHING OUT TO US YOU WILL BE PERMANENTLY BLACKLISTED.</p>

<p>****UPDATE 12/11/16
<br />We maintained impeccable feedback on Alphabay for the first 4 months of being in business, until I decided to bring a couple "trusted" associates in to help with the business, and as soon as I made that decision things started going down hill immediately. Some packages never went out and were lied about, some packages mysteriously dissapeared, shipping information was lost, people's orders were delayed embarrassing amounts of time, finally very recently culminating in a VERY LARGE amount of BTC being "lossed" when a withdrawal was stupidly and carelessly made to an "unknown" wallet address putting the entire business in jeopardy. Following that incident I made the decision to get rid of ALL of them, and am once again operating entirely independently as I was in the beginning when things were working like clockwork and ALL customers were in love with our product and customer service. </p>

<p>Now that I am once again running every aspect of the business myself, I can assure every customer that you will ALWAYS receive the same connoisseur grade product and your orders will be shipped promptly on schedule 100% of the time. </p>

<p>-All orders will be treated with the same quality of care when it comes to stealth and making sure they ALL make it safely to their destinations. 
<br /> 
<br />-We will always try to ship same day whenever possible, but any orders received before midnight PST will go out that next day no matter what.   </p>

<p>-We offer both USPS priority and Express shipping methods, as well as FedEx Guaranteed Overnight.</p>

<p>-Feel free to PM us about custom orders of any size.</p>

<p>****JUST BECAUSE AN ORDER IS MARKED SHIPPED DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN IT IS IN THE MAIL, IT JUST MEANS WE HAVE BEGUN THE SHIPPING/PACKAGING PROCESS. PLEASE ALWAYS ALLOW UP TO 48 HOURS FOR HANDLING BEFORE THE PACKAGE IS ACTUALLY SENT. THIS IS RARELY THE CASE AS ORDERS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS SENT SAME DAY, BUT IN RARE SITUATIONS IT CAN BE. </p>

<p>****PLEASE DO NOT SEND US MESSAGES ASKING FOR DEALS, FRONTS, OR ANY KIND OF SPECIAL TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. </p>

<p>****IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR ORDER PLEASE SEND US A PM BEFORE POSTING ANY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND WE WILL DO ANYTHING WE CAN TO FIX THE ISSUE. IF YOU POST NEGATIVE FEEDBACK BEFORE REACHING OUT TO US YOU WILL BE PERMANENTLY BLACKLISTED.</p>

<p>****WE DO NOT REFUND OR RESHIP UNLESS THE PROBLEM IS OUR FAULT (i.e. a typo in shipping info or something similar). If you place an order please be sure that the address you provide is ok to receive your mail because if you decide to change your shipping address last minute via PM we will not be held liable for you not receiving your package due to it going to the original address provided in your order. </p>
