<br />October-Dec.     - Takes 3-6 Weeks  (Varies Depending on Location)</p>

<br />________________________________________________________________
<br />----------General Info To New Customers Regarding Shipping Times-----------
<br />_________________________________________________________________
<br />        To All Customer Please do not go by the feedback for delivery times, Every area is different and changes from day to day. Tomorrows delivery times could take 2 weeks longer then today's. 
<br />       It all depends on the mail load at sorting facility's and customs load on both ends, how much mail volume is currently going through the postal system and where the weekends fell (Since nothing is processed in CAD on them). As well as many other factors and variables like your distance to mail outlet or airport.  
<br />    Throughout the year these delivery times change based on many factors(Listed Above) and this is why we put in every listing page, our TOS page and in the order details we send out with each order the times it can and does take. 
<br />     It is guaranteed that one of your orders Will take 4 weeks at some point in time ordering from us, Especially near Xmas.This is where our Shipping estimates are from as they are based from all our past order times over the last 5 years.
<br /> 
<br />________________________________________________________________
<br />-------------Tips + Ordering Practices to Follow Year Round for International Customers-----------
<br />_________________________________________________________________
<br /> Best Times to order I would say are 1PM-10PM YOUR TIIME, which is 7AM-2PM our time Roughly Depending on your time zone and Country. These are ususally the best times to order on   Monday-Thursday and No later then 7PM your time or 11AM PST (Which is our time) if its large order on a Thursday as this will help give us adequit time to do all our needed packaging and security checks on the items we are sending also. This also ensures we will be more likely to get the order out  the same day - Thursday (not always but if we are not swampped) and it's always best to ensure orders make it out during the week and not with weekend mail. 
<br />     Also, Customers should look up a Canadian Calendar (Or grab a cheap one)and mark down Canada Holdays and All Weekends including Friday as unless the order is in to be processed for Thursday its Very rare they make it out Firday since Fridays only seem to have an early morning Pickup that starts the processing and sorting, all the pickups after that time Friday I'm almost positive sit at the sorting facility over the weekend. And Every holiday weekend here where a holiday falls on a Sat-Sun. ends up being a Long Weekend and is best to avoid shipping the Friday of that weekend as you will then have almost 4 days of you item not moving since if it was placed Friday it would not make the earliest Friday pickup, Some rare holiday weekends they decide to put the holiday on the Friday instead and for those you would want to give an additional day and make sure the order is with us no later then Wensday Night (Your time)!  Cheers</p>

<p>(This is also why we are almost never on at the same time as majority of our customers and we will always change our login times from day to day and week to week as another basic security precaution of the darket)</p>

When we are in the Month prior to Xmas we do not Accept ANY new customers. Sorry but at this time of year to many new customers simply read feedback for delivery times and not the information we set out for them.</p>

<p>********************************************
<br />Proper Address format / Listings info
<br />*********************************************
<br />Double Check your Address is in its proper format! 
<br />It is not our responsibility to make sure you have typed your address correctly so if it is found that you made the error when giving us your address it will void your reship policy for that order. So tripple check it is correct as we copy and paste it. (Commas are not needed to seperate each line as it will show up on our end fine, as well you do not need to label each line as if you are from an area we are not familiar with we will double check with you before shipping if anything looks off, but we have shipped to many Country's over the years and are familiar with almost every country's address formats!)</p>

<p>NAME
<br />STREET NUMBER AND NAME
<br />CITY
<br />POSTAL CODE ( WITH THE PROPER SPACEES)
<br />COUNTRY (Please always put the country)</p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>Finalizing Orders</p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>Please note if your order is not finalized within 24 hours it may be cancelled and the Amount refunded at your expense, </p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>Shipping/Stealth</p>

<p>**************************************************************
<br />New Customers Using P.O Boxes Please be advised P.O boxes are not a very safe way to have items sent to. Some P.O box company's reserve rights to search all mail that they store in there facilitys and will usually result in Issues. We will no longer Offer shipping for new customers to P.O Box's!</p>

<p>I DO NOT ship to:
<br /> Austrailia, Asia, Russia, Mexico, South America, Ireland (But Northern Ireland is fine), Germany, India or Sweden </p>

<p>All Items are Shipped Standard Stealth Regular Mail - No we will not elaborate on that.</p>

<p>Nothing is Shipped on Weekends or Holidays Due to post office being Closed.</p>

<p>Shipping Estimates are as follows (Best case-Worst Case times)(DO NOT GO BY FEEDBACK)</p>

<p>Canada Xpress Post 3-5 Days
<br />Canada - 4-9 Days *Holidays 5-9 Days
<br />US - 6-21 Days *Holidays 9-21 Days
<br />International - 1-4 Weeks *Holidays 3-6 Weeks</p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>RESHIPS / REFUNDS</p>

<p>**************************************************************
<br />"We have not nor will we ever offer any kind of REFUND in BTC, We have done our Refund Policy based on Reships over the last 5 years and has been satisfactory for everyone who has ever needed one, this is not negotiable in any way."</p>

<p>- The Sole Purpose for The Reship Policy was to ensure that no one orders and had a bad experience!</p>

<p>- If your Item does not Make it I will Give 50% reship upto QP order or 2oz Reship Max(This applies to Verified country's only....Canada, UK, EU, France and US) * This is for Buyers who have at least 5+ Previous positive feedback. This is Determined on a case by case basis! Our Large Customers that order over a HP at a time and have Verified to order such amounts would fall under the Case by case basis, so please make sure you contact us.</p>

<p>- To Be eligable you must maintain communication regarding the order and notify me when it is first deemed late, @ the 4 week mark,(This means messaging us 2 months later hoping the sites order or info rolled off wont help you in anyway) Once the 4 week mark has passed depending on the time of year additional time for monitoring it until the full amount of time is reached may be necissary. (Mainly around Xmas or Mail issues posted on either Royal Mail - Canada Mail or other public mail centers). Otherwise once the 4 weeks have passed and you fall under all the criteria qualifying you for a reship then contact us and we will be sure to get it out!</p>

<p>- The Reships are on a one time offer basis (If you have been with us for a long time, 6 months+, there may be additional Reships but this is based soley at our discretion and based upon your ordering historys and past issues)</p>

<p>- New Customers if your first order does not make it and a reship is required, we will live up to our policy but you will no longer be able to order and this may also determine the ability for future deliverys to your entire Country. 
<br />Country's that have to many customers with dodgy business styles we will Ban completely as a whole.</p>

<p>- Any one who does not want to wait the full delivery time that is listed above, in the items listings and in the order details we send to you upon placing an order or anyone who leaves negative feedback before contacting us to work our any issues with an order, or anyone who attempts to extort us in any way or makes a statement to us hinting at this will immediately be banned from future orders and will be giving up there rights to any reship in doing so! 
<br />We will also contact the admins to inform them of this user and the account will likely get banned as most markets take is seriously.  These days when customers agree to the TOS of a seller by placing an order with them and then disagree halfway through the process this is a considerably frowned upon business method.</p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>FEEDBACK</p>

<p>**************************************************************
<br />"We Would Appreciate if the customers who orders take Longer could also post those times in the feedback as we would rather have customers post there times whether they are quick or not. Rather then only post quick times as to many customers are basing there information off of this, and many do not realize that when ever a time is not given is was usually not a quick time and there are some as well who choose to not even leave feedback"</p>

<p>Please do not leave anything less then Perfect feedback When you are rating me if your complaint is for a weed preference then put it in the text. But the rating is based on the Product, Description and Shipping and my accuracy to do that for others too see. 
<br />Also, if anything less then 5/5 or 100% Positive feedback is left without contacting us first to come to a joint solution this will also lead to the ban of your account from future orders. </p>

<p>We are very easy going and will always try to work out any issues with out customers, That being said do not mistake our kind nature for a weakness as we have seen every trick in the book over the last 4+ Years and will not stand for attempts to scam us!</p>

<p>***********************************************************
<br />INFO
<br />**********************************************************</p>

<p>I at no time Guarantee any of my strains are only large buds all of the time,
<br />All large buds are evenly dispersed through everyone's bags to be fair to all. 
<br />Each strain vary's in strength each batch depending on many variables. I will however never
<br />put wet,damp or dust in the bags. Keep in mind along its trip from being handled by the
<br />postman there is usually some bottoms that can arise from buds bouncing around on there journey!</p>

<p>Our criteria for New strains are as follows 
<br />1. How clean the buds smokes - we try to get a nice clean smoke so it burns as smooth as possible (this is affected by how the growers flush all the plant foods out in the last couple of weeks before they chop down and if they do not give the plant anything but just water for a minimum of 2 weeks you get a not very nicely flushed batch)
<br />2. The THC content throughout - We check that the buds have nice THC not just on the buds but throughout if you break a bud open
<br />3. Last of the 3 is the Size and look of the buds, we will always pick a strain with the above 2 criteria before picking one with large buds or a little bit nicer buds as how the bud smokes and strength of it is much more important then the size. </p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>PGP - Security</p>

<p>**************************************************************</p>

<p>I encourage all customers to use pgp to encrypt your address when ordering</p>
