<p><p>Please read description for details of quality. thanks
<br />Improvements.
<br />Paper: Very similar to the original as it is made of the same material. Crispness is good and it also makes a good sound. Real notes can have a slight waxy feel, a light coating of hairspray can help with that or use a candle if you like If you crumple them to age them a little try not to do too much. A few creases is best I think.
<br />Hologram strip: I must apologies for the strip last time. I have to keep on trying new methods and that particular method was not as good as the previous way. This time I invested some money on some equipment and the hologram is the best one ever. Of course it will not be 100 % perfect as these are fake after all!
<br />Security strip: same goes for this.
<br />Serial numbers: I now have 3 variations of numbers. I won't guarantee that every note get will be a different number. They will be packed randomly so they won't all be the same.
<br />Stealth: Will be sent in a plain white DL envelope with a printed label with your address on (as you sent it to me, so please write it out properly) Large orders will be sent differently which will depend on the size.
<br />UV: none. will be done next time.
<br />Colour: The notes are now more like the original (less blue, more mauve)
<br />Stock: It has been hard to produce notes in large volumes due to machinery not working properly etc. but after investing more time and money I can produce notes a lot faster now so stock shouldn't run out as fast.
<br />*PEN TEST unfortunately they do not pass the pen test. I realised this after I printed the batch. My paper supplier in china majorly fucked up! I promise next time the pen test test will be the first thing I check! I have lowered the price because of this and I apologies as I know you have been waiting for my next next batch for a while.
<br />If you are not happy I will refund you in full. I only refund samples because its not my fault if you are too impatient to order a sample first.
<br />It is important that you finalize the payment once you have received your order and are happy with it.
<br />*****
<br />I am getting way too many messages asking the same questions so please read these points instead of asking me (my time is better spent creating notes)
<br />I do
<br />• Appreciate questions about bulk orders and I do want to do business with you. I’m just stressed at the moment because of the demand but once I can produce more notes more quickly we can certainly talk about 10-20k packs!
<br />• Have a plan to make the whole procedure more automated so that stock is always available.
<br />I do not
<br />• Make any other notes, only GBP 20
<br />• Take any other payments other than bitcoin
<br />• Use any instant messenger programs
<br />• Want to meet you somewhere
<br />• Text you or give you my phone number
<br />• Care how long you have been waiting, this is not an easy process and it takes as long as it takes
<br />No you cannot
<br />• Pay these into your bank
<br />• Use ther payments other than bitcoin
<br />• Use them in a vending machine
<br />Some tips for passing these notes
<br />When I said you can pass 1000-2000 pounds a day I wasn’t joking. It is totally possible but it is hard work! One day I spent close to £2000. I started early and got the train to a city quite far from my home. I stopped in every café, fast food joint, Starbucks etc. and ordered the cheapest coffee they had and threw it straight in the bin. All the staff were young, busy and female and were also very tired. It was easy. (if the staff didn’t fit that description I moved on) Then I hit every food place in my path and if I saw any shop with young staff I hit those too. I basically did that all day, just planned my route and kept going. After a few hours my pockets were bulging with real cash and I was tired but on a roll. That evening I was still in the same city so I went out for a drink, I hit every pub and bar and just left the drinks and walked out with my change. After that I did every kebab house, burger van and late night shop in sight. Finally I got a couple of cabs and used the fake cash no probs.I have to say once you do a few successful transactions your confidence grows and it gets easier. The fact is that these busy, young workers are really not thinking about fake notes at all! So if you smile, pay and be completely normal they probably won’t give the note a second look.I didn’t want to carry tons of fake cash just in case the worse happened and the police were called so I have a water bottle with a secret stash compartment (from eBay) where I kept all the notes. I just took out one at a time. If caught I would just say that I sold my phone on gumtree and the buyer must have given me a fake note. Or if the police are involved just say you found it.</p></p>
