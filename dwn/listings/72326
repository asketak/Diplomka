<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>

<p>Half-pound (224 g) of high quality Sweet Kush greenhouse weed. Sweet Kush is the potent daughter of Sweet Tooth and OG Kush. Sweet Kush has a combination of a citrusy &amp; sweet smell while its taste is also citrusy and sweet; Sweet Kush tastes just like a lemon drop candy. Combining the best of both cannabis types, this hybrid provides both head and body effects. After the first taste, consumers typically experience a cerebral sensation. A few minutes later, body effects begin to dominate, relaxing muscles and easing pain. Sweet Kush consumers may feel lazy and sedated, making this a good after work or nighttime strain. </p>

<p>SHIPPING:</p>

<p>ABOUT US:</p>

<p>MistaGreenabis is from AlphaBay. We decided to give this market a try. We are an experienced team when it comes to marijuana. We've been in the cannabis industry for 11 years so cultivating, dealing, &amp; blazing weed isn't new to us. The cannabis we sell are the ones that we also smoke. We do not and will never sell weed that we wouldn't smoke. All strains are greenhouse grown. </p>

<p>WHY CHOOSE US? </p>

<p>We are fast, honest, and professional. We do not and will never keep your address. Your address is deleted right after we ship out your order. We will try to package and ship out your order on the same day that you made a purchase and hope that postal service can deliver it to you within 7 days. Our packages usually arrive within 5 days. Unlike some vendors we don't use stolen pics of cannabis and send you different/poor quality buds. Take a look at our pics they are real we even printed out our vendor name and put it in the background to show you our products are actual. Our stealth is excellent. We vacuum-sealed 3x with mylar bags and clean the outer layer of each bag with rubbing alcohol after its sealed so there won't be any odor nor smell of weed until you cut all the bags open.  We also value our customers so we welcome your questions/concern any time.</p>

<p>WHAT BUYER MUST KNOW:</p>

<p>The description of our buds is based on our personal opinion only. We have tested all of our different strains before putting them on the market. Please keep in mind our opinion on our products may differ from yours. For example what is A-Grade weed to us might be B-Grade to you. What is B-Grade weed to you might be A-Grade to another customer. We just want to be honest with you so please keep this in mind. </p>

<p>~Q&amp;A~</p>

<p>Q: Do you provide tracking? </p>

<p>A: Sorry no we do not provide tracking; however if your order doesn't arrive within 7 days (not counting Sunday) then please do not hesitate to PM us and we will gladly check the status of your package for you. But even though we don't provide tracking your coins are safe in escrow. </p>

<p>Q: How do I know you won't scam me? </p>

<p>A: There is no way for us to scam you because your coins will be in escrow while you wait for your package to arrive. Plus take a look at our feedbacks on AlphaBay we have over 100 positives in sales. You will learn most of our customers are very satisfied with our service. </p>

<p>Q: Do you ship express/overnight? </p>

<p>A: No, we do not ship express nor overnight. Shipping express/overnight raises a red flag and we do not want to jeopardize nor get our customers in trouble with law enforcement. </p>

<p>Q: Will there be any shake with my order? </p>

<p>A: We do not guranteed our buds will be shake-free although they are nicely trimmed. However, we always filter out and remove any shakes before packaging the buds. </p>

<p>Q: Do your buds have seeds?</p>

<p>A: We do not guranteed our buds will be seedless but we always check for and get rid of seeds at the time of trimming. We also check for seeds again prior to bagging/packaging the buds. But to be honest our buds are pretty much seedless. Buds with seeds are usually from a stressed plant (lacking water &amp; nutrient, high temperature, etc). We always take good care of our plants during cultivation we water them on schedule with compost tea and never let them go hungry nor thirsty. 
<br /> 
<br />Q: Will my weed arrive in perfect condition? </p>

<p>A: We cannot gurantee your product will arrive in the same condition as when it was with us. Please be informed your package will go through shipping/transportation process and maybe different weather condition; the package could possibly get tossed around by postal workers too.</p>

<p>Q: Do you compress the buds? </p>

<p>A: No we do not compress the weed unless requested by customer. We vaccum-sealed them just enough so they won't shake during delivery process. </p>

<p>Q: How long should I wait for my order before contacting you? </p>

<p>A: Shipping usually takes 3 days (on average) but it also depends on postal service, weather, and time of the year. From experience sometimes there are delays during/near holidays. After you place an order please give us 7 days to deliver package to you before contacting us to check status.</p>

<p>TERMS &amp; AGREEMENT</p>

<p>~ Buyer must provide accurate shipping address. Please type it down twice (do not copy &amp; paste). Send address in the following format:</p>

<p>Laura Johnson 
<br />4823 Eastwood St
<br />San Francisco, CA 94130</p>

<p>Laura Johnson 
<br />4823 Eastwood St
<br />San Francisco, CA 94130</p>

<p>note: We're requiring you to do this because from experience there have been a few customers who have provided inaccurate address. We will help you check to see if both addresses you type match.
<br /> 
<br />~ Refund will not be given under any circumstance; the only exception is if vendor sent order to the wrong address or an address that does not match the one provided by buyer. In this case buyer has the option to request a reship or refund. </p>

<p>~ Packages that got lost/stolen during shipping process will be replaced with one more. If 2nd shipment fails then BTC in escrow will be split evenly (50/50) between buyer &amp; vendor. A package is declared lost/stolen after 25 days from order date so customer will need to patiently wait (we advise you to extend escrow time in this situation). </p>

<p>~ Buyer must release escrow within 48 hrs of receiving package. </p>

<p>~ Vendor gets full escrow amount if buyer provided the wrong address or if package was sent to the wrong address provided by buyer. </p>

<p>By placing an order means you've read and agree to MistaGreenabis' terms and agreement.</p></p>
