<p>WHY PREMIUM SPORES?</p>

<p>1.	Our spore syringes are packed with 100% real mushroom spores, not carbon or other additives that will make your microscopy experiments impossible.</p>

<p>2.	There are so many spores in our items that you can see them with your bare eyes.</p>

<p>3.	We do not use jet-dry or any detergents to thicken our aqueous solution, which makes spores nonviable sometimes.</p>

<p>4.	Our customer support is second to none. If you need our assistance with your order, we respond promptly and professionally. Many of our competitors fail to respond if you need help. Donâ€™t get left hanging!</p>

<p>5.	We are not affiliates of another company or re-sellers of other peoples products. We hand make your syringes with proper equipment.</p>

<p>6.	We offer a 20 day from delivery exchange guarantee. If you should have any issue with your item we replace them free of charge, no questions asked. Simply contact us!</p>

<p>7.	All of our items are made with the highest quality hardware available which in turn provides you with the best possible chances of being successful in your endeavors. We take great pride in our products and customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>All of our items are professionally created and assembled. Our spore syringes come individually packaged in individual zipper bags that are clearly marked as the item you selected, and will have tip caps installed on them to prevent leaking and contamination. The needle that is required to dispense the liquid on to microscope slides will never arrive installed. Instead it comes inside of the package unopened, and sterile. Many companies fail to package their items properly as it does require an extra expense to put the items in their own bag with tip caps. We spare no expense to provide the best hardware for our items that we send to you.</p>

<p>Our shipping is 100% discreet. No mention of the contents or your order will appear on your packaging. We ship in plain brown packaging, and thats it. If you want to buy mushroom spores, you should only buy them from the best!  Shipping &amp; Handling: To all orders add $6 for 2 to 3 day priority mail shipping in the U.S.A. All orders are sent in plain discreet envelopes and boxes that say nothing about spores or mushrooms. </p>

<p>International orders. We do NOT ship spore syringes internationally (outside the U.S.A.), although we may ship spore prints to other countries. </p>

<p>How long do spores stay alive?: I get this question a lot and there is no exact science to it. I give my customers a 90 day guarantee. Most vendors are only 30 or less. I've had one customer tell me spore syringes stayed good for 5 years, and others tell me a couple years, yet sometimes I hear they are no good after 6 months. Storing spore syringes in air tight containers in the fridge can greatly prolong their life. Spore PRINTS should only be stored in the fridge if they are sealed from moisture, such as vacuum sealing.</p></p>
