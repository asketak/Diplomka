<p>¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸</p>

<p>This is a private listing that's reserved only for people that can pass the following intelligence test. You must read and follow all instructions. It's purposely lengthy with no pictures to ensure that unqualified people cannot pass the test. If you fail, your order will be canceled, your bitcoins will be refunded and I may or may not notify you about how you failed. Show me that you are a mature adult and make me feel that you are competent enough to be working with me.</p>

<p>MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS PART 1 :: PICK A RECIPIENT NAME
<br />Out of the 1% or 2% of envelopes that never made it to my customers, most of them were ones where the customer never specified a name and I just made one up for them. I don't do this anymore. You need to select a name that's already being used at your address. It can be the name of a prior resident that is still receiving junk mail as long as you're certain that they don't have mail forwarding set up. DO NOT MISSPELL the name. Misspelled names are one of the top things that PIs look for when profiling mail for inspection. DO NOT abbreviate the first or last name. I at least need a full first and last name. You may add a middle initial, prefix and/or suffix if you feel that it will help you better identify the mail amongst your other usual mail.</p>

<p>MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS PART 2 :: FORMAT YOUR ADDRESS THE OFFICIAL USPS WAY
<br />By 'format' I mean make it nice and pretty exactly the way USPS likes to see it on your shipping label. Use the USPS link below to do this. The address you provide should look exactly like USPS's tool shows your address. YOU MUST PROVIDE ME WITH YOUR FULL 9 DIGIT ZIP CODE. This takes out all of the guesswork on my end. If USPS tells me that your address requires an apartment or unit number, you must provide me with the correct apt or unit number or include a note explaining that USPS is incorrect about your address requiring a number. Do not put redundant things like 'Please ship to:' or 'Street:' or 'Zip code:' or 'United States of America'. I assure you that I passed Geography class in grade-school and I can understand your address if you send it to me properly. In some rare hill-billy cases, USPS won't have the correct notation and the last four digits of your zip in their system, and only your local postman recognizes your address. In these cases I need you to provide me a picture of proof showing that your name and address can receive mail. DO NOT use addresses for abandoned houses. I do not refund or reship for erroneous addresses.
<br />https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action</p>

<p>MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS PART 3 :: ENCRYPT YOUR RECIPIENT INFORMATION
<br />Encrypt your recipient info for everything you purchase on the deep web even if it's just glow-in-the dark shoe lace. If you haven't already learned how to use PGP software, just use haneWIN's JavascriptPG tool at http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGcrypt.htm
<br />I AM NO LONGER ACCEPTING privnote OR sms4tor MESSAGES OR ANYTHING LIKE THESE SERVICES. haneWIN's JavascriptPG is extremely easy, so you have no excuses. NOTE: You'll need to temporarily turn on Javascript for it to work. Please don't 'sign' your encrypted msgs. The only thing this does is it causes me to have to backspace a lot when I make your shipping label.</p>

<p>★★ NO FREEBEES ★★
<br />No free samples.</p>

<p>★★ SHIPPING OPTIONS ★★
<br />▨ [FirstClass] ↔ 3 to 12 days ↔ only for quantities of 1g through 4g
<br />▨ [Priority] ↔ 2 to 4 days ↔ only for quantities of 5g or greater
<br />Envelopes get dropped off at the post office within 1 business day. I rarely miss a day. And if there's a day that I might be missing, I almost always have a notice on my profile page explaining beforehand so that you'll know what to expect. Orders typically don't get processed same-day unless they are placed shortly after midnight. Keep in mind that orders made on Saturday aren't going to be processed until the post office reopens on Monday. Another example worth noting is that if you place an Express order on say a Tuesday afternoon, keep in mind that it won't get dropped off at the post office until Wednesday, so you won't be receiving it until Thursday. None of my shipping options will require interaction with the postman. They will arrive in your mail box with no signature required. Also don't be alarmed that I don't msg you with a warm welcoming msg for each order that you place. As much as I would like to have an automated msg greeting everybody and giving them confirmation that their envelope made it to the post office on time like say eBay, the orders panel on my end is designed to be as low-bandwidth and efficient as possible and therefore does not have any tools for me to effectively send out confirmation msgs. If the status of your transaction says it's being shipped, and I haven't msged you saying anything about a problem with your address, then yes I have processed your order successfully.
<br />NO INTERNATIONAL. Please do not ask me to do international orders.</p>

<p>★★ POSTAL HOLIDAYS 2017 ★★
<br />• Monday, January 2 - New Year's

<p>★★ PAYMENT ★★
<br />I only accept payment through the bitcoin escrow system. No exceptions. So don't ask. Bitcoins are an integral part of what makes this service so secure (and so fun). Also please don't ask me how to use the shopping system. Prove to me that you are a competent adult and that you can figure these parts out on your own. I do not intend to do business with children or anyone that seems to lack a basic understanding of the nature of this business or how to use one of the simplest shopping cart systems ever made.

<p>★★ TRUE STORY ★★
<br />I have an extremely high standard in the quality of my product and the integrity of my service. I love love love meeting professionals that have the same passion for exploring and sharing psychedelics as I do. I aspire to be the most secure and reliable dealer that I can possibly be for you. I'm at your service. I'm not interested in doing business with people show signs of having a destructive life-style, and I am likely to refuse business that I feel may have a negative impact on our society. My passion is to be a provider of tools that encourage happiness, positive relationship experiences, higher awareness and creativity. May the force be with Dread Pirate Roberts and may the Righteous continue to research for the win.</p></p>
