<p>All syringes are 10 ml/cc</p>

<p>The Treasure Coast cuubnesis spores come from the Treasure Coast area of Florida, which refers to an area along the eastern coast where sunken treasure ships are located. This strain is a unique white cubensis. The white cubensis starts off a very light brown, then changes to the frosted white at about 1 1/2" to 2" tall as it matures. All the substrains of the TC will have a frost look on the caps, and look quite beautiful. </p>

<p>Habitat: Bovine, Equine Dung and Enriched Soils
<br />Climate: Subtropical</p>

<p>Strain Origin: Florida, Southern Gulf Coast, USA</p>

<p>Cap: 15-25 mm in diameter, convex to broadly convex to plane at maturity. Brown maturing to golden brown to light yellow. Surface dry with a few small remnants of universal veil on cap (spots). Flesh white soon bruising bluish green.</p>

<p>Stem: 50-125 mm in length, yellowish. Flesh bruising bluish green where injured. Persistent membranous annulus (ring) from partial veil that becomes dusted with purple brown spores at maturity.</p>

<p>Gills: Attachment adnate to adnexed. Grayish coloration in young fruit bodies becoming nearly black in maturity.</p>

<p>Spores: Dark purplish brown, subellipsoid on 4-spored basidia</p>

<p>WHY PREMIUM SPORES?</p>

<p>1.	Our spore syringes are packed with 100% real mushroom spores, not carbon or other additives that will make your microscopy experiments impossible.</p>

<p>2.	There are so many spores in our items that you can see them with your bare eyes.</p>

<p>3.	We do not use jet-dry or any detergents to thicken our aqueous solution, which makes spores nonviable sometimes.</p>

<p>4.	Our customer support is second to none. If you need our assistance with your order, we respond promptly and professionally. Many of our competitors fail to respond if you need help. Donâ€™t get left hanging!</p>

<p>5.	We are not affiliates of another company or re-sellers of other peoples products. We hand make your syringes with proper equipment.</p>

<p>6.	We offer a 20 day from delivery exchange guarantee. If you should have any issue with your item we replace them free of charge, no questions asked. Simply contact us!</p>

<p>7.	All of our items are made with the highest quality hardware available which in turn provides you with the best possible chances of being successful in your endeavors. We take great pride in our products and customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>All of our items are professionally created and assembled. Our spore syringes come individually packaged in individual zipper bags that are clearly marked as the item you selected, and will have tip caps installed on them to prevent leaking and contamination. The needle that is required to dispense the liquid on to microscope slides will never arrive installed. Instead it comes inside of the package unopened, and sterile. Many companies fail to package their items properly as it does require an extra expense to put the items in their own bag with tip caps. We spare no expense to provide the best hardware for our items that we send to you.</p>

<p>Our shipping is 100% discreet. No mention of the contents or your order will appear on your packaging. We ship in plain brown packaging, and thats it. If you want to buy mushroom spores, you should only buy them from the best!  Shipping &amp; Handling: To all orders add $6 for 2 to 3 day priority mail shipping in the U.S.A. All orders are sent in plain discreet envelopes and boxes that say nothing about spores or mushrooms.</p></p>
